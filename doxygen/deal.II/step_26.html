<p>This program implements the heat equation </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} \frac{\partial u(\mathbf x, t)}{\partial t} - \Delta u(\mathbf x, t) &amp;= f(\mathbf x, t), \qquad\qquad &amp;&amp; \forall \mathbf x \in \Omega, t\in (0,T), \\ u(\mathbf x, 0) &amp;= u_0(\mathbf x) &amp;&amp; \forall \mathbf x \in \Omega, \\ \\ u(\mathbf x, t) &amp;= g(\mathbf x,t) &amp;&amp; \forall \mathbf x \in \partial\Omega, t \in (0,T). \end{align*}
</p>
<p> In some sense, this equation is simpler than the ones we have discussed in the preceding programs <a class="el" href="step_23.html">step-23</a>, <a class="el" href="step_24.html">step-24</a>, <a class="el" href="step_25.html">step-25</a>, namely the wave equation. This is due to the fact that the heat equation smoothes out the solution over time, and is consequently more forgiving in many regards. For example, when using implicit time stepping methods, we can actually take large time steps, we have less trouble with the small disturbances we introduce through adapting the mesh every few time steps, etc.</p>
<p>Our goal here will be to solve the equations above using the theta-scheme that discretizes the equation in time using the following approach, where we would like \(u^n(\mathbf x)\) to approximate \(u(\mathbf x, t_n)\) at some time \(t_n\): </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} \frac{u^n(\mathbf x)-u^{n-1}(\mathbf x)}{k_n} - \left[ (1-\theta)\Delta u^{n-1}(\mathbf x) + \theta\Delta u^n(\mathbf x) \right] &amp;= \left[ (1-\theta)f(\mathbf x, t_{n-1}) + \theta f(\mathbf x, t_n) \right]. \end{align*}
</p>
<p> Here, \(k_n=t_n-t_{n-1}\) is the time step size. The theta-scheme generalizes the explicit Euler ( \(\theta=0\)), implicit Euler ( \(\theta=1\)) and Crank-Nicolson ( \(\theta=\frac 12\)) time discretizations. Since the latter has the highest convergence order, we will choose \(\theta=\frac 12\) in the program below, but make it so that playing with this parameter remains simple. (If you are interested in playing with higher order methods, take a look at <a class="el" href="step_52.html">step-52</a>.)</p>
<p>Given this time discretization, space discretization happens as it always does, by multiplying with test functions, integrating by parts, and then restricting everything to a finite dimensional subspace. This yields the following set of fully discrete equations after multiplying through with \(k_n\): </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} M U^n-MU^{n-1} + k_n \left[ (1-\theta)A U^{n-1} + \theta A U^n \right] &amp;= k_n \left[ (1-\theta)F^{n-1} + \theta F^n \right], \end{align*}
</p>
<p> where \(M\) is the mass matrix and \(A\) is the stiffness matrix that results from discretizing the Laplacian. Bringing all known quantities to the right hand side yields the linear system we have to solve in every step: </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} (M + k_n \theta A) U^n &amp;= MU^{n-1} - k_n (1-\theta)A U^{n-1} + k_n \left[ (1-\theta)F^{n-1} + \theta F^n \right]. \end{align*}
</p>
<p> The linear system on the left hand side is symmetric and positive definite, so we should have no trouble solving it with the Conjugate Gradient method.</p>
<p>We can start the iteration above if we have the set of nodal coefficients \(U^0\) at the initial time. Here, we take the ones we get by interpolating the initial values \(u_0(\mathbf x)\) onto the mesh used for the first time step. We will also need to choose a time step; we will here just choose it as fixed, but clearly advanced simulators will want to choose it adaptively. We will briefly come back to this in the <a href="#Results">results section below</a>.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Adaptingmeshesfortimedependentproblems"></a></p><h3>Adapting meshes for time dependent problems </h3>
<p>When solving the wave equation and its variants in the previous few programs, we kept the mesh fixed. Just as for stationary equations, one can make a good case that this is not the smartest approach and that significant savings can be had by adapting the mesh. There are, however, significant difficulties compared to the stationary case. Let us go through them in turn:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="startli"><em>Time step size and minimal mesh size</em>: For stationary problems, the general approach is "make the mesh as fine as it is necessary". For problems with singularities, this often leads to situations where we get many levels of refinement into corners or along interfaces. The very first tutorial to use adaptive meshes, <a class="el" href="step_6.html">step-6</a>, is a point in case already.</p>
<p>However, for time dependent problems, we typically need to choose the time step related to the mesh size. For explicit time discretizations, this is obvious, since we need to respect a CFL condition that ties the time step size to the smallest mesh size. For implicit time discretizations, no such hard restriction exists, but in practice we still want to make the time step smaller if we make the mesh size smaller since we typically have error estimates of the form \(\|e\| \le {\cal O}(k^p + h^q)\) where \(p,q\) are the convergence orders of the time and space discretization, respectively. We can only make the error small if we decrease both terms. Ideally, an estimate like this would suggest to choose \(k \propto h^{q/p}\). Because, at least for problems with non-smooth solutions, the error is typically localized in the cells with the smallest mesh size, we have to indeed choose \(k \propto h_{\text{min}}^{q/p}\), using the <em>smallest</em> mesh size.</p>
<p>The consequence is that refining the mesh further in one place implies not only the moderate additional effort of increasing the number of degrees of freedom slightly, but also the much larger effort of having the solve the <em>global</em> linear system more often because of the smaller time step.</p>
<p>In practice, one typically deals with this by acknowledging that we can not make the time step arbitrarily small, and consequently can not make the local mesh size arbitrarily small. Rather, we set a maximal level of refinement and when we flag cells for refinement, we simply do not refine those cells whose children would exceed this maximal level of refinement.</p>
<p>There is a similar problem in that we will choose a right hand side that will switch on in different parts of the domain at different times. To avoid being caught flat footed with too coarse a mesh in areas where we suddenly need a finer mesh, we will also enforce in our program a <em>minimal</em> mesh refinement level.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli"><em>Test functions from different meshes</em>: Let us consider again the semi-discrete equations we have written down above: </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} \frac{u^n(\mathbf x)-u^{n-1}(\mathbf x)}{k_n} - \left[ (1-\theta)\Delta u^{n-1}(\mathbf x) + \theta\Delta u^n(\mathbf x) \right] &amp;= \left[ (1-\theta)f(\mathbf x, t_{n-1}) + \theta f(\mathbf x, t_n) \right]. \end{align*}
</p>
<p> We can here consider \(u^{n-1}\) as data since it has presumably been computed before. Now, let us replace </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} u^n(\mathbf x)\approx u_h^n(\mathbf x) = \sum_j U^n \varphi_j(\mathbf x), \end{align*}
</p>
<p> multiply with test functions \(\varphi_i(\mathbf x)\) and integrate by parts where necessary. In a process as outlined above, this would yield </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} \sum_j (M + k_n \theta A)_{ij} U^n_j &amp;= (\varphi_i, u_h^{n-1}) - k_n (1-\theta)(\nabla \varphi_i, \nabla u_h^{n-1}) + k_n \left[ (1-\theta)F^{n-1} + \theta F^n \right]. \end{align*}
</p>
<p> Now imagine that we have changed the mesh between time steps \(n-1\) and \(n\). Then the problem is that the basis functions we use for \(u_h^n\) and \(u^{n-1}\) are different! This pertains to the terms on the right hand side, the first of which we could more clearly write as (the second follows the same pattern) </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} (\varphi_i, u_h^{n-1}) = (\varphi_i^n, u_h^{n-1}) = \sum_{j=1}^{N_{n-1}} (\varphi_i^n, \varphi_j^{n-1}) U^{n-1}_j, \qquad\qquad i=1\ldots N_n. \end{align*}
</p>
<p> If the meshes used in these two time steps are the same, then \((\varphi_i^n, \varphi_j^{n-1})\) forms a square mass matrix \(M_{ij}\). However, if the meshes are not the same, then in general the matrix is rectangular. Worse, it is difficult to even compute these integrals because if we loop over the cells of the mesh at time step \(n\), then we need to evaluate \(\varphi_j^{n-1}\) at the quadrature points of these cells, but they do not necessarily correspond to the cells of the mesh at time step \(n-1\) and \(\varphi_j^{n-1}\) is not defined via these cells; the same of course applies if we wanted to compute the integrals via integration on the cells of mesh \(n-1\).</p>
<p>In any case, what we have to face is a situation where we need to integrate shape functions defined on two different meshes. This can be done, and is in fact demonstrated in <a class="el" href="step_28.html">step-28</a>, but the process is at best described by the word "awkward".</p>
<p class="endli">In practice, one does not typically want to do this. Rather, we avoid the whole situation by interpolating the solution from the old to the new mesh every time we adapt the mesh. In other words, rather than solving the equations above, we instead solve the problem </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} \sum_j (M + k_n \theta A)_{ij} U^n_j &amp;= (\varphi_i, I_h^n u_h^{n-1}) - k_n (1-\theta)(\nabla \varphi_i, \nabla I_h^n u_h^{n-1}) + k_n \left[ (1-\theta)F^{n-1} + \theta F^n \right], \end{align*}
</p>
<p> where \(I_h^n\) is the interpolation operator onto the finite element space used in time step \(n\). This is not the optimal approach since it introduces an additional error besides time and space discretization, but it is a pragmatic one that makes it feasible to do time adapting meshes. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="anchor" id="WhatcouldpossiblygowrongVerifyingwhetherthecodeiscorrect"></a></p><h3>What could possibly go wrong? Verifying whether the code is correct </h3>
<p>There are a number of things one can typically get wrong when implementing a finite element code. In particular, for time dependent problems, the following are common sources of bugs:</p><ul>
<li>The time integration, for example by getting the coefficients in front of the terms involving the current and previous time steps wrong (e.g., mixing up a factor \(\theta\) for \(1-\theta\)).</li>
<li>Handling the right hand side, for example forgetting a factor of \(k_n\) or \(\theta\).</li>
<li>Mishandling the boundary values, again for example forgetting a factor of \(k_n\) or \(\theta\), or forgetting to apply nonzero boundary values not only to the right hand side but also to the system matrix.</li>
</ul>
<p>A less common problem is getting the initial conditions wrong because one can typically see that it is wrong by just outputting the first time step. In any case, in order to verify the correctness of the code, it is helpful to have a testing protocol that allows us to verify each of these components separately. This means:</p><ul>
<li>Testing the code with nonzero initial conditions but zero right hand side and boundary values and verifying that the time evolution is correct.</li>
<li>Then testing with zero initial conditions and boundary values but nonzero right hand side and again ensuring correctness.</li>
<li>Finally, testing with zero initial conditions and right hand side but nonzero boundary values.</li>
</ul>
<p>This sounds complicated, but fortunately, for linear partial differential equations without coefficients (or constant coefficients) like the one here, there is a fairly standard protocol that rests on the following observation: if you choose as your domain a square \([0,1]^2\) (or, with slight modifications, a rectangle), then the exact solution can be written as </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} u(x,y,t) = a(t) \sin(n_x \pi x) \sin(n_y \pi y) \end{align*}
</p>
<p> (with integer constants \(n_x,n_y\)) if only the initial condition, right hand side and boundary values are all of the form \(\sin(n_x \pi x) \sin(n_y \pi y)\) as well. This is due to the fact that the function \(\sin(n_x \pi x) \sin(n_y \pi y)\) is an eigenfunction of the Laplace operator and allows us to compute things like the time factor \(a(t)\) analytically and, consequently, compare with what we get numerically.</p>
<p>As an example, let us consider the situation where we have \(u_0(x,y)=\sin(n_x \pi x) \sin(n_x \pi y)\) and \(f(x,y,t)=0\). With the claim (ansatz) of the form for \(u(x,y,t)\) above, we get that </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} -\Delta\right) u(x,y,t) &amp;= \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} -\Delta\right) a(t) \sin(n_x \pi x) \sin(n_y \pi y) \\ &amp;= \left(a&#39;(t) + (n_x^2+n_y^2)\pi^2 a(t) \right) \sin(n_x \pi x) \sin(n_y \pi y). \end{align*}
</p>
<p> For this to be equal to \(f(x,y,t)=0\), we need that </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} a&#39;(t) + (n_x^2+n_y^2)\pi^2 a(t) = 0 \end{align*}
</p>
<p> and due to the initial conditions, \(a(0)=1\). This differential equation can be integrated to yield </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} a(t) = - e^{-(n_x^2+n_y^2)\pi^2 t}. \end{align*}
</p>
<p> In other words, if the initial condition is a product of sines, then the solution has exactly the same shape of a product of sines that decays to zero with a known time dependence. This is something that is easy to test if you have a sufficiently fine mesh and sufficiently small time step.</p>
<p>What is typically going to happen if you get the time integration scheme wrong (e.g., by having the wrong factors of \(\theta\) or \(k\) in front of the various terms) is that you don't get the right temporal behavior of the solution. Double check the various factors until you get the right behavior. You may also want to verify that the temporal decay rate (as determined, for example, by plotting the value of the solution at a fixed point) does not double or halve each time you double or halve the time step or mesh size. You know that it's not the handling of the boundary conditions or right hand side because these were both zero.</p>
<p>If you have so verified that the time integrator is correct, take the situation where the right hand side is nonzero but the initial conditions are zero: \(u_0(x,y)=0\) and \(f(x,y,t)=\sin(n_x \pi x) \sin(n_x \pi y)\). Again, </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} -\Delta\right) u(x,y,t) &amp;= \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} -\Delta\right) a(t) \sin(n_x \pi x) \sin(n_y \pi y) \\ &amp;= \left(a&#39;(t) + (n_x^2+n_y^2)\pi^2 a(t) \right) \sin(n_x \pi x) \sin(n_y \pi y), \end{align*}
</p>
<p> and for this to be equal to \(f(x,y,t)\), we need that </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} a&#39;(t) + (n_x^2+n_y^2)\pi^2 a(t) = 1 \end{align*}
</p>
<p> and due to the initial conditions, \(a(0)=0\). Integrating this equation in time yields </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} a(t) = \frac{1}{(n_x^2+n_y^2)\pi^2} \left[ 1 - e^{-(n_x^2+n_y^2)\pi^2 t} \right]. \end{align*}
</p>
<p>Again, if you have the wrong factors of \(\theta\) or \(k\) in front of the right hand side terms you will either not get the right temporal behavior of the solution, or it will converge to a maximum value other than \(\frac{1}{(n_x^2+n_y^2)\pi^2}\).</p>
<p>Once we have verified that the time integration and right hand side handling are correct using this scheme, we can go on to verifying that we have the boundary values correct, using a very similar approach.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Thetestcase"></a></p><h3>The testcase </h3>
<p>Solving the heat equation on a simple domain with a simple right hand side almost always leads to solutions that are exceedingly boring, since they become very smooth very quickly and then do not move very much any more. Rather, we here solve the equation on the L-shaped domain with zero Dirichlet boundary values and zero initial conditions, but as right hand side we choose </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} f(\mathbf x, t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \chi_1(\mathbf x) &amp; \text{if \(0\le t \le 0.2\tau\) or \(\tau\le t \le 1.2\tau\) or \(2\tau\le t \le 2.2\tau\), etc} \\ \chi_2(\mathbf x) &amp; \text{if \(0.5\le t \le 0.7\tau\) or \(1.5\tau\le t \le 1.7\tau\) or \(2.5\tau\le t \le 2.7\tau\), etc} \\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{array} \right. \end{align*}
</p>
<p> Here, </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} \chi_1(\mathbf x) &amp;= \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \text{if \(x&gt;0.5\) and \(y&gt;-0.5\)} \\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{array} \right. \\ \chi_2(\mathbf x) &amp;= \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \text{if \(x&gt;-0.5\) and \(y&gt;0.5\)} \\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{array} \right. \end{align*}
</p>
<p> In other words, in every period of length \(\tau\), the right hand side first flashes on in domain 1, then off completely, then on in domain 2, then off completely again. This pattern is probably best observed via the little animation of the solution shown in the <a href="#Results">results section</a>.</p>
<p>If you interpret the heat equation as finding the spatially and temporally variable temperature distribution of a conducting solid, then the test case above corresponds to an L-shaped body where we keep the boundary at zero temperature, and heat alternatingly in two parts of the domain. While heating is in effect, the temperature rises in these places, after which it diffuses and diminishes again. The point of these initial conditions is that they provide us with a solution that has singularities both in time (when sources switch on and off) as well as time (at the reentrant corner as well as at the edges and corners of the regions where the source acts).</p>

<p>The next piece is the declaration of the main class of this program. It follows the well trodden path of previous examples. If you have looked at <a class="el" href="step_6.html">step-6</a>, for example, the only thing worth noting here is that we need to build two matrices (the mass and Laplace matrix) and keep the current and previous time step's solution. We then also need to store the current time, the size of the time step, and the number of the current time step. The last of the member variables denotes the theta parameter discussed in the introduction that allows us to treat the explicit and implicit Euler methods as well as the Crank-Nicolson method and other generalizations all in one program.</p>
<p>As far as member functions are concerned, the only possible surprise is that the <code>refine_mesh</code> function takes arguments for the minimal and maximal mesh refinement level. The purpose of this is discussed in the introduction.</p>

<p>It is time now for the implementation of the main class. Let's start with the constructor which selects a linear element, a time step constant at 1/500 (remember that one period of the source on the right hand side was set to 0.2 above, so we resolve each period with 100 time steps) and chooses the Crank Nicolson method by setting \(\theta=1/2\).</p>

<p>The next function is the one that sets up the <a class="el" href="classDoFHandler.html">DoFHandler</a> object, computes the constraints, and sets the linear algebra objects to their correct sizes. We also compute the mass and Laplace matrix here by simply calling two functions in the library.</p>
<p>Note that we do not take the hanging node constraints into account when assembling the matrices (both functions have an <a class="el" href="classAffineConstraints.html">AffineConstraints</a> argument that defaults to an empty object). This is because we are going to condense the constraints in <a class="el" href="namespaceWorkStream_1_1internal_1_1tbb__no__coloring.html#a8673698a405bf47aa24002aeb6d76d70">run()</a> after combining the matrices for the current time-step.</p>

<p>This function is the interesting part of the program. It takes care of the adaptive mesh refinement. The three tasks this function performs is to first find out which cells to refine/coarsen, then to actually do the refinement and eventually transfer the solution vectors between the two different grids. The first task is simply achieved by using the well-established Kelly error estimator on the solution. The second task is to actually do the remeshing. That involves only basic functions as well, such as the <code>refine_and_coarsen_fixed_fraction</code> that refines those cells with the largest estimated error that together make up 60 per cent of the error, and coarsens those cells with the smallest error that make up for a combined 40 per cent of the error. Note that for problems such as the current one where the areas where something is going on are shifting around, we want to aggressively coarsen so that we can move cells around to where it is necessary.</p>
<p>As already discussed in the introduction, too small a mesh leads to too small a time step, whereas too large a mesh leads to too little resolution. Consequently, after the first two steps, we have two loops that limit refinement and coarsening to an allowable range of cells:</p>

In the first loop, instead of calling <code><a class="el" href="namespaceTrilinosWrappers_1_1internal.html#aee42c8e3004e2e81eac3c3356d3ec46b">triangulation.end()</a></code> we may as well have called <code>triangulation.end_active(max_grid_level)</code>. The two calls should yield the same iterator since iterators are sorted by level and there should not be any cells on levels higher than on level <code>max_grid_level</code>. In fact, this very piece of code makes sure that this is the case.</p>
<p>As part of mesh refinement we need to transfer the solution vectors from the old mesh to the new one. To this end we use the <a class="el" href="classSolutionTransfer.html">SolutionTransfer</a> class and we have to prepare the solution vectors that should be transferred to the new grid (we will lose the old grid once we have done the refinement so the transfer has to happen concurrently with refinement). At the point where we call this function, we will have just computed the solution, so we no longer need the old_solution variable (it will be overwritten by the solution just after the mesh may have been refined, i.e., at the end of the time step; see below). In other words, we only need the one solution vector, and we copy it to a temporary object where it is safe from being reset when we further down below call <code>setup_system()</code>.</p>
<p>Consequently, we initialize a <a class="el" href="classSolutionTransfer.html">SolutionTransfer</a> object by attaching it to the old DoF handler. We then prepare the triangulation and the data vector for refinement (in this order).</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><a class="code" href="classSolutionTransfer.html">SolutionTransfer&lt;dim&gt;</a> solution_trans(dof_handler);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><a class="code" href="classVector.html">Vector&lt;double&gt;</a> previous_solution;</div><div class="line">previous_solution = solution;</div><div class="line">triangulation.<a class="code" href="classTriangulation.html#ab9fa3177e0e43ab0cf243215d284a35a">prepare_coarsening_and_refinement</a>();</div><div class="line">solution_trans.prepare_for_coarsening_and_refinement(previous_solution);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Now everything is ready, so do the refinement and recreate the DoF structure on the new grid, and finally initialize the matrix structures and the new vectors in the <code>setup_system</code> function. Next, we actually perform the interpolation of the solution from old to new grid. The final step is to apply the hanging node constraints to the solution vector, i.e., to make sure that the values of degrees of freedom located on hanging nodes are so that the solution is continuous. This is necessary since <a class="el" href="classSolutionTransfer.html">SolutionTransfer</a> only operates on cells locally, without regard to the neighborhood.</p>

<p>This is the main driver of the program, where we loop over all time steps. At the top of the function, we set the number of initial global mesh refinements and the number of initial cycles of adaptive mesh refinement by repeating the first time step a few times. Then we create a mesh, initialize the various objects we will work with, set a label for where we should start when re-running the first time step, and interpolate the initial solution onto out mesh (we choose the zero function here, which of course we could do in a simpler way by just setting the solution vector to zero). We also output the initial time step once.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>If you're an experienced programmer, you may be surprised that we use a <code>goto</code> statement in this piece of code! <code>goto</code> statements are not particularly well liked any more since Edsgar Dijkstra, one of the greats of computer science, wrote a letter in 1968 called "Go To Statement considered harmful" (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Considered_harmful">here</a>). The author of this code subscribes to this notion whole-heartedly: <code>goto</code> is hard to understand. In fact, deal.II contains virtually no occurrences: excluding code that was essentially transcribed from books and not counting duplicated code pieces, there are 3 locations in about 600,000 lines of code at the time this note is written; we also use it in 4 tutorial programs, in exactly the same context as here. Instead of trying to justify the occurrence here, let's first look at the code and we'll come back to the issue at the end of function.</dd></dl>

<p>In the end, one might simply agree that <em>in general</em> <code>goto</code> statements are a bad idea but be pragmatic and state that there may be occasions where they can help avoid code duplication and awkward control flow.

<div class="image">
<img src="https://www.dealii.org/images/steps/developer/step-26.movie.gif" alt="Animation of the solution of step 26."/>
</div>
<p>The movie shows how the two sources switch on and off and how the mesh reacts to this. It is quite obvious that the mesh as is is probably not the best we could come up with. We'll get back to this in the next section.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="extensions"></a> <a class="anchor" id="Possibilitiesforextensions"></a></p><h3>Possibilities for extensions</h3>
<p>There are at least two areas where one can improve this program significantly: adaptive time stepping and a better choice of the mesh.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Adaptivetimestepping"></a></p><h4>Adaptive time stepping</h4>
<p>Having chosen an implicit time stepping scheme, we are not bound by any CFL-like condition on the time step. Furthermore, because the time scales on which change happens on a given cell in the heat equation are not bound to the cells diameter (unlike the case with the wave equation, where we had a fixed speed of information transport that couples the temporal and spatial scales), we can choose the time step as we please. Or, better, choose it as we deem necessary for accuracy.</p>
<p>Looking at the solution, it is clear that the action does not happen uniformly over time: a lot is changing around the time we switch on a source, things become less dramatic once a source is on for a little while, and we enter a long phase of decline when both sources are off. During these times, we could surely get away with a larger time step than before without sacrificing too much accuracy.</p>
<p>The literature has many suggestions on how to choose the time step size adaptively. Much can be learned, for example, from the way ODE solvers choose their time steps. One can also be inspired by a posteriori error estimators that can, ideally, be written in a way that the consist of a temporal and a spatial contribution to the overall error. If the temporal one is too large, we should choose a smaller time step. Ideas in this direction can be found, for example, in the PhD thesis of a former principal developer of deal.II, Ralf Hartmann, published by the University of Heidelberg, Germany, in 2002.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Bettertimesteppingmethods"></a></p><h4>Better time stepping methods</h4>
<p>We here use one of the simpler time stepping methods, namely the second order in time Crank-Nicolson method. However, more accurate methods such as Runge-Kutta methods are available and should be used as they do not represent much additional effort. It is not difficult to implement this for the current program, but a more systematic treatment is also given in <a class="el" href="step_52.html">step-52</a>.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Betterrefinementcriteria"></a></p><h4>Better refinement criteria</h4>
<p>If you look at the meshes in the movie above, it is clear that they are not particularly well suited to the task at hand. In fact, they look rather random.</p>
<p>There are two factors at play. First, there are some islands where cells have been refined but that are surrounded by non-refined cells (and there are probably also a few occasional coarsened islands). These are not terrible, as they most of the time do not affect the approximation quality of the mesh, but they also don't help because so many of their additional degrees of freedom are in fact constrained by hanging node constraints. That said, this is easy to fix: the <a class="el" href="classTriangulation.html">Triangulation</a> class takes an argument to its constructor indicating a level of "mesh smoothing". Passing one of many possible flags, this instructs the triangulation to refine some additional cells, or not to refine some cells, so that the resulting mesh does not have these artifacts.</p>
<p>The second problem is more severe: the mesh appears to lag the solution. The underlying reason is that we only adapt the mesh once every fifth time step, and only allow for a single refinement in these cases. Whenever a source switches on, the solution had been very smooth in this area before and the mesh was consequently rather coarse. This implies that the next time step when we refine the mesh, we will get one refinement level more in this area, and five time steps later another level, etc. But this is not enough: first, we should refine immediately when a source switches on (after all, in the current context we at least know what the right hand side is), and we should allow for more than one refinement level. Of course, all of this can be done using deal.II, it just requires a bit of algorithmic thinking in how to make this work!</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Positivitypreservation"></a></p><h4>Positivity preservation</h4>
<p>To increase the accuracy and resolution of your simulation in time, one typically decreases the time step size \(k_n\). If you start playing around with the time step in this particular example, you will notice that the solution becomes partly negative, if \(k_n\) is below a certain threshold. This is not what we would expect to happen (in nature).</p>
<p>To get an idea of this behavior mathematically, let us consider a general, fully discrete problem: </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} A u^{n} = B u^{n-1}. \end{align*}
</p>
<p> The general form of the \(i\)th equation then reads: </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} a_{ii} u^{n}_i &amp;= b_{ii} u^{n-1}_i + \sum\limits_{j \in S_i} \left( b_{ij} u^{n-1}_j - a_{ij} u^{n}_j \right), \end{align*}
</p>
<p> where \(S_i\) is the set of degrees of freedom that DoF \(i\) couples with (i.e., for which either the matrix \(A\) or matrix \(B\) has a nonzero entry at position \((i,j)\)). If all coefficients fulfill the following conditions: </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} a_{ii} &amp;&gt; 0, &amp; b_{ii} &amp;\geq 0, &amp; a_{ij} &amp;\leq 0, &amp; b_{ij} &amp;\geq 0, &amp; \forall j &amp;\in S_i, \end{align*}
</p>
<p> all solutions \(u^{n}\) keep their sign from the previous ones \(u^{n-1}\), and consequently from the initial values \(u^0\). See e.g. <a href="http://bookstore.siam.org/cs14/">Kuzmin, H&auml;m&auml;l&auml;inen</a> for more information on positivity preservation.</p>
<p>Depending on the PDE to solve and the time integration scheme used, one is able to deduce conditions for the time step \(k_n\). For the heat equation with the Crank-Nicolson scheme, <a href="https://doi.org/10.2478/cmam-2010-0025">Schatz et. al.</a> have translated it to the following ones: </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} (1 - \theta) k a_{ii} &amp;\leq m_{ii},\qquad \forall i, &amp; \theta k \left| a_{ij} \right| &amp;\geq m_{ij},\qquad j \neq i, \end{align*}
</p>
<p> where \(M = m_{ij}\) denotes the mass matrix and \(A = a_{ij}\) the stiffness matrix with \(a_{ij} \leq 0\) for \(j \neq i\), respectively. With \(a_{ij} \leq 0\), we can formulate bounds for the global time step \(k\) as follows: </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} k_{\text{max}} &amp;= \frac{ 1 }{ 1 - \theta } \min\left( \frac{ m_{ii} }{ a_{ii} } \right),~ \forall i, &amp; k_{\text{min}} &amp;= \frac{ 1 }{ \theta } \max\left( \frac{ m_{ij} }{ \left|a_{ij}\right| } \right),~ j \neq i. \end{align*}
</p>
<p> In other words, the time step is constrained by <em>both a lower and upper bound</em> in case of a Crank-Nicolson scheme. These bounds should be considered along with the CFL condition to ensure significance of the performed simulations.</p>
<p>Being unable to make the time step as small as we want to get more accuracy without losing the positivity property is annoying. It raises the question of whether we can at least <em>compute</em> the minimal time step we can choose to ensure positivity preservation in this particular tutorial. Indeed, we can use the <a class="el" href="classSparseMatrix.html">SparseMatrix</a> objects for both mass and stiffness that are created via the <a class="el" href="namespaceMatrixCreator.html">MatrixCreator</a> functions. Iterating through each entry via <a class="el" href="namespaceSparseMatrixIterators.html">SparseMatrixIterators</a> lets us check for diagonal and off-diagonal entries to set a proper time step dynamically. For quadratic matrices, the diagonal element is stored as the first member of a row (see <a class="el" href="classSparseMatrix.html">SparseMatrix</a> documentation). An exemplary code snippet on how to grab the entries of interest from the <code>mass_matrix</code> is shown below.</p>

(All video lectures are also available &lt;a href="http://www.math.colostate.edu/~bangerth/videos.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)  (  See also &lt;a href="http://www.math.colostate.edu/~bangerth/videos.676.31.7.html"&gt;video lecture 31.7&lt;/a&gt;.)  
</pre><p>This program implements the heat equation </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} \frac{\partial u(\mathbf x, t)}{\partial t} - \Delta u(\mathbf x, t) &amp;= f(\mathbf x, t), \qquad\qquad &amp;&amp; \forall \mathbf x \in \Omega, t\in (0,T), \\ u(\mathbf x, 0) &amp;= u_0(\mathbf x) &amp;&amp; \forall \mathbf x \in \Omega, \\ \\ u(\mathbf x, t) &amp;= g(\mathbf x,t) &amp;&amp; \forall \mathbf x \in \partial\Omega, t \in (0,T). \end{align*}
</p>
<p> In some sense, this equation is simpler than the ones we have discussed in thepreceding programs <a class="el" href="step_23.html">step-23</a> , <a class="el" href="step_24.html">step-24</a> , <a class="el" href="step_25.html">step-25</a> , namely the wave equation. Thisis due to the fact that the heat equation smoothes out the solution over time,and is consequently more forgiving in many regards. For example, when usingimplicit time stepping methods, we can actually take large time steps, we haveless trouble with the small disturbances we introduce through adapting themesh every few time steps, etc. Our goal here will be to solve the equations above using the theta-scheme thatdiscretizes the equation in time using the following approach, where we wouldlike \(u^n(\mathbf x)\) to approximate \(u(\mathbf x, t_n)\) at some time \(t_n\) : </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} \frac{u^n(\mathbf x)-u^{n-1}(\mathbf x)}{k_n} - \left[ (1-\theta)\Delta u^{n-1}(\mathbf x) + \theta\Delta u^n(\mathbf x) \right] &amp;= \left[ (1-\theta)f(\mathbf x, t_{n-1}) + \theta f(\mathbf x, t_n) \right]. \end{align*}
</p>
<p> Here, \(k_n=t_n-t_{n-1}\) is the time step size. The theta-scheme generalizesthe explicit Euler ( \(\theta=0\) ), implicit Euler ( \(\theta=1\) ) andCrank-Nicolson ( \(\theta=\frac 12\) ) time discretizations. Since the latter hasthe highest convergence order, we will choose \(\theta=\frac 12\) in the programbelow, but make it so that playing with this parameter remains simple. (If youare interested in playing with higher order methods, take a look at <a class="el" href="step_52.html">step-52</a> .) Given this time discretization, space discretization happens as it alwaysdoes, by multiplying with test functions, integrating by parts, and thenrestricting everything to a finite dimensional subspace. This yields thefollowing set of fully discrete equations after multiplying through with \(k_n\) : </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} M U^n-MU^{n-1} + k_n \left[ (1-\theta)A U^{n-1} + \theta A U^n \right] &amp;= k_n \left[ (1-\theta)F^{n-1} + \theta F^n \right], \end{align*}
</p>
<p> where \(M\) is the mass matrix and \(A\) is the stiffness matrix that results fromdiscretizing the Laplacian. Bringing all known quantities to the right handside yields the linear system we have to solve in every step: </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} (M + k_n \theta A) U^n &amp;= MU^{n-1} - k_n (1-\theta)A U^{n-1} + k_n \left[ (1-\theta)F^{n-1} + \theta F^n \right]. \end{align*}
</p>
<p> The linear system on the left hand side is symmetric and positive definite, sowe should have no trouble solving it with the Conjugate Gradient method. We can start the iteration above if we have the set of nodal coefficients \(U^0\) at the initial time. Here, we take the ones we get by interpolating theinitial values \(u_0(\mathbf x)\) onto the mesh used for the first time step. Wewill also need to choose a time step; we will here just choose it as fixed,but clearly advanced simulators will want to choose it adaptively. We willbriefly come back to this in the <a href="#Results">results section below</a>.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Adaptingmeshesfortimedependentproblems"></a></p><h3>Adapting meshes for time dependent problems </h3>
<p>When solving the wave equation and its variants in the previous few programs,we kept the mesh fixed. Just as for stationary equations, one can make a goodcase that this is not the smartest approach and that significant savings canbe had by adapting the mesh. There are, however, significant difficultiescompared to the stationary case. Let us go through them in turn: </p><ul>
<li>
<em>Time step size and minimal mesh size</em>: For stationary problems, the general approach is "make the mesh as fine as it is necessary". For problems with singularities, this often leads to situations where we get many levels of refinement into corners or along interfaces. The very first tutorial to use adaptive meshes, <a class="el" href="step_6.html">step-6</a> , is a point in case already. However, for time dependent problems, we typically need to choose the time step related to the mesh size. For explicit time discretizations, this is obvious, since we need to respect a CFL condition that ties the time step size to the smallest mesh size. For implicit time discretizations, no such hard restriction exists, but in practice we still want to make the time step smaller if we make the mesh size smaller since we typically have error estimates of the form \(\|e\| \le {\cal O}(k^p + h^q)\) where \(p,q\) are the convergence orders of the time and space discretization, respectively. We can only make the error small if we decrease both terms. Ideally, an estimate like this would suggest to choose \(k \propto h^{q/p}\) . Because, at least for problems with non-smooth solutions, the error is typically localized in the cells with the smallest mesh size, we have to indeed choose \(k \propto h_{\text{min}}^{q/p}\) , using the <em>smallest</em> mesh size. The consequence is that refining the mesh further in one place implies not only the moderate additional effort of increasing the number of degrees of freedom slightly, but also the much larger effort of having the solve the <em>global</em> linear system more often because of the smaller time step. In practice, one typically deals with this by acknowledging that we can not make the time step arbitrarily small, and consequently can not make the local mesh size arbitrarily small. Rather, we set a maximal level of refinement and when we flag cells for refinement, we simply do not refine those cells whose children would exceed this maximal level of refinement. There is a similar problem in that we will choose a right hand side that will switch on in different parts of the domain at different times. To avoid being caught flat footed with too coarse a mesh in areas where we suddenly need a finer mesh, we will also enforce in our program a <em>minimal</em> mesh refinement level. </li>
<li>
<em>Test functions from different meshes</em>: Let us consider again the semi-discrete equations we have written down above: <p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} \frac{u^n(\mathbf x)-u^{n-1}(\mathbf x)}{k_n} - \left[ (1-\theta)\Delta u^{n-1}(\mathbf x) + \theta\Delta u^n(\mathbf x) \right] &amp;= \left[ (1-\theta)f(\mathbf x, t_{n-1}) + \theta f(\mathbf x, t_n) \right]. \end{align*}
</p>
 We can here consider \(u^{n-1}\) as data since it has presumably been computed before. Now, let us replace <p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} u^n(\mathbf x)\approx u_h^n(\mathbf x) = \sum_j U^n \varphi_j(\mathbf x), \end{align*}
</p>
 multiply with test functions \(\varphi_i(\mathbf x)\) and integrate by parts where necessary. In a process as outlined above, this would yield <p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} \sum_j (M + k_n \theta A)_{ij} U^n_j &amp;= (\varphi_i, u_h^{n-1}) - k_n (1-\theta)(\nabla \varphi_i, \nabla u_h^{n-1}) + k_n \left[ (1-\theta)F^{n-1} + \theta F^n \right]. \end{align*}
</p>
 Now imagine that we have changed the mesh between time steps \(n-1\) and \(n\) . Then the problem is that the basis functions we use for \(u_h^n\) and \(u^{n-1}\) are different! This pertains to the terms on the right hand side, the first of which we could more clearly write as (the second follows the same pattern) <p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} (\varphi_i, u_h^{n-1}) = (\varphi_i^n, u_h^{n-1}) = \sum_{j=1}^{N_{n-1}} (\varphi_i^n, \varphi_j^{n-1}) U^{n-1}_j, \qquad\qquad i=1\ldots N_n. \end{align*}
</p>
 If the meshes used in these two time steps are the same, then \((\varphi_i^n, \varphi_j^{n-1})\) forms a square mass matrix \(M_{ij}\) . However, if the meshes are not the same, then in general the matrix is rectangular. Worse, it is difficult to even compute these integrals because if we loop over the cells of the mesh at time step \(n\) , then we need to evaluate \(\varphi_j^{n-1}\) at the quadrature points of these cells, but they do not necessarily correspond to the cells of the mesh at time step \(n-1\) and \(\varphi_j^{n-1}\) is not defined via these cells; the same of course applies if we wanted to compute the integrals via integration on the cells of mesh \(n-1\) . In any case, what we have to face is a situation where we need to integrate shape functions defined on two different meshes. This can be done, and is in fact demonstrated in <a class="el" href="step_28.html">step-28</a> , but the process is at best described by the word "awkward". In practice, one does not typically want to do this. Rather, we avoid the whole situation by interpolating the solution from the old to the new mesh every time we adapt the mesh. In other words, rather than solving the equations above, we instead solve the problem <p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} \sum_j (M + k_n \theta A)_{ij} U^n_j &amp;= (\varphi_i, I_h^n u_h^{n-1}) - k_n (1-\theta)(\nabla \varphi_i, \nabla I_h^n u_h^{n-1}) + k_n \left[ (1-\theta)F^{n-1} + \theta F^n \right], \end{align*}
</p>
 where \(I_h^n\) is the interpolation operator onto the finite element space used in time step \(n\) . This is not the optimal approach since it introduces an additional error besides time and space discretization, but it is a pragmatic one that makes it feasible to do time adapting meshes. </li>
</ul>
<p><a class="anchor" id="WhatcouldpossiblygowrongVerifyingwhetherthecodeiscorrect"></a></p><h3>What could possibly go wrong? Verifying whether the code is correct </h3>
<p>There are a number of things one can typically get wrong when implementing afinite element code. In particular, for time dependent problems, the followingare common sources of bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li>The time integration, for example by getting the coefficients in front of the terms involving the current and previous time steps wrong (e.g., mixing up a factor \(\theta\) for \(1-\theta\) ).</li>
<li>Handling the right hand side, for example forgetting a factor of \(k_n\) or \(\theta\) .</li>
<li>Mishandling the boundary values, again for example forgetting a factor of \(k_n\) or \(\theta\) , or forgetting to apply nonzero boundary values not only to the right hand side but also to the system matrix. A less common problem is getting the initial conditions wrong because one cantypically see that it is wrong by just outputting the first time step. In anycase, in order to verify the correctness of the code, it is helpful to have atesting protocol that allows us to verify each of these componentsseparately. This means:</li>
<li>Testing the code with nonzero initial conditions but zero right hand side and boundary values and verifying that the time evolution is correct.</li>
<li>Then testing with zero initial conditions and boundary values but nonzero right hand side and again ensuring correctness.</li>
<li>Finally, testing with zero initial conditions and right hand side but nonzero boundary values. This sounds complicated, but fortunately, for linear partial differentialequations without coefficients (or constant coefficients) like the one here,there is a fairly standard protocol that rests on the following observation:if you choose as your domain a square \([0,1]^2\) (or, with slightmodifications, a rectangle), then the exact solution can be written as <p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} u(x,y,t) = a(t) \sin(n_x \pi x) \sin(n_y \pi y) \end{align*}
</p>
 (with integer constants \(n_x,n_y\) )if only the initial condition, right hand side and boundary values are allof the form \(\sin(n_x \pi x) \sin(n_y \pi y)\) as well. This is due to the factthat the function \(\sin(n_x \pi x) \sin(n_y \pi y)\) is an eigenfunction of theLaplace operator and allows us to compute things like the time factor \(a(t)\) analytically and, consequently, compare with what we get numerically. As an example, let us consider the situation where we have \(u_0(x,y)=\sin(n_x \pi x) \sin(n_x \pi y)\) and \(f(x,y,t)=0\) . With the claim (ansatz) of the form for \(u(x,y,t)\) above, we get that <p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} -\Delta\right) u(x,y,t) &amp;= \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} -\Delta\right) a(t) \sin(n_x \pi x) \sin(n_y \pi y) \\ &amp;= \left(a&#39;(t) + (n_x^2+n_y^2)\pi^2 a(t) \right) \sin(n_x \pi x) \sin(n_y \pi y). \end{align*}
</p>
 For this to be equal to \(f(x,y,t)=0\) , we need that <p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} a&#39;(t) + (n_x^2+n_y^2)\pi^2 a(t) = 0 \end{align*}
</p>
 and due to the initial conditions, \(a(0)=1\) . This differential equation can beintegrated to yield <p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} a(t) = - e^{-(n_x^2+n_y^2)\pi^2 t}. \end{align*}
</p>
 In other words, if the initial condition is a product of sines, then thesolution has exactly the same shape of a product of sines that decays to zerowith a known time dependence. This is something that is easy to test if youhave a sufficiently fine mesh and sufficiently small time step. What is typically going to happen if you get the time integration scheme wrong(e.g., by having the wrong factors of \(\theta\) or \(k\) in front of the variousterms) is that you don't get the right temporal behavior of thesolution. Double check the various factors until you get the rightbehavior. You may also want to verify that the temporal decay rate (asdetermined, for example, by plotting the value of the solution at a fixedpoint) does not double or halve each time you double or halve the time step ormesh size. You know that it's not the handling of theboundary conditions or right hand side because these were both zero. If you have so verified that the time integrator is correct, take thesituation where the right hand side is nonzero but the initial conditions arezero: \(u_0(x,y)=0\) and \(f(x,y,t)=\sin(n_x \pi x) \sin(n_x \pi y)\) . Again, <p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} -\Delta\right) u(x,y,t) &amp;= \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} -\Delta\right) a(t) \sin(n_x \pi x) \sin(n_y \pi y) \\ &amp;= \left(a&#39;(t) + (n_x^2+n_y^2)\pi^2 a(t) \right) \sin(n_x \pi x) \sin(n_y \pi y), \end{align*}
</p>
 and for this to be equal to \(f(x,y,t)\) , we need that <p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} a&#39;(t) + (n_x^2+n_y^2)\pi^2 a(t) = 1 \end{align*}
</p>
 and due to the initial conditions, \(a(0)=0\) . Integrating this equation in timeyields <p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} a(t) = \frac{1}{(n_x^2+n_y^2)\pi^2} \left[ 1 - e^{-(n_x^2+n_y^2)\pi^2 t} \right]. \end{align*}
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, if you have the wrong factors of \(\theta\) or \(k\) in front of the righthand side terms you will either not get the right temporal behavior of thesolution, or it will converge to a maximum value other than \(\frac{1}{(n_x^2+n_y^2)\pi^2}\) . Once we have verified that the time integration and right hand side handlingare correct using this scheme, we can go on to verifying that we have theboundary values correct, using a very similar approach.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Thetestcase"></a></p><h3>The testcase </h3>
<p>Solving the heat equation on a simple domain with a simple right hand sidealmost always leads to solutions that are exceedingly boring, since theybecome very smooth very quickly and then do not move very much anymore. Rather, we here solve the equation on the L-shaped domain with zeroDirichlet boundary values and zero initial conditions, but as right hand sidewe choose </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} f(\mathbf x, t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \chi_1(\mathbf x) &amp; \text{if \(0\le t \le 0.2\tau\) or \(\tau\le t \le 1.2\tau\) or \(2\tau\le t \le 2.2\tau\), etc} \\ \chi_2(\mathbf x) &amp; \text{if \(0.5\le t \le 0.7\tau\) or \(1.5\tau\le t \le 1.7\tau\) or \(2.5\tau\le t \le 2.7\tau\), etc} \\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{array} \right. \end{align*}
</p>
<p> Here, </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} \chi_1(\mathbf x) &amp;= \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \text{if \(x&gt;0.5\) and \(y&gt;-0.5\)} \\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{array} \right. \\ \chi_2(\mathbf x) &amp;= \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \text{if \(x&gt;-0.5\) and \(y&gt;0.5\)} \\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{array} \right. \end{align*}
</p>
<p> In other words, in every period of length \(\tau\) , the right hand side firstflashes on in domain 1, then off completely, then on in domain 2, then offcompletely again. This pattern is probably best observed via the littleanimation of the solution shown in the <a href="#Results">results section</a>. If you interpret the heat equation as finding the spatially and temporallyvariable temperature distribution of a conducting solid, then the test caseabove corresponds to an L-shaped body where we keep the boundary at zerotemperature, and heat alternatingly in two parts of the domain. While heatingis in effect, the temperature rises in these places, after which it diffusesand diminishes again. The point of these initial conditions is that theyprovide us with a solution that has singularities both in time (when sourcesswitch on and off) as well as time (at the reentrant corner as well as at theedges and corners of the regions where the source acts).</p>

<p>The next piece is the declaration of the main class of this program. It follows the well trodden path of previous examples. If you have looked at <a class="el" href="step_6.html">step-6</a> , for example, the only thing worth noting here is that we need to build two matrices (the mass and Laplace matrix) and keep the current and previous time step's solution. We then also need to store the current time, the size of the time step, and the number of the current time step. The last of the member variables denotes the theta parameter discussed in the introduction that allows us to treat the explicit and implicit Euler methods as well as the Crank-Nicolson method and other generalizations all in one program. As far as member functions are concerned, the only possible surprise is that the <code>refine_mesh</code> function takes arguments for the minimal and maximal mesh refinement level. The purpose of this is discussed in the introduction.</p>

<p>It is time now for the implementation of the main class. Let's start with the constructor which selects a linear element, a time step constant at 1/500 (remember that one period of the source on the right hand side was set to 0.2 above, so we resolve each period with 100 time steps) and chooses the Crank Nicolson method by setting \(\theta=1/2\) .</p>

<p>The next function is the one that sets up the <a class="el" href="classDoFHandler.html">DoFHandler</a> object, computes the constraints, and sets the linear algebra objects to their correct sizes. We also compute the mass and Laplace matrix here by simply calling two functions in the library. Note that we do not take the hanging node constraints into account when assembling the matrices (both functions have an <a class="el" href="classAffineConstraints.html">AffineConstraints</a> argument that defaults to an empty object). This is because we are going to condense the constraints in <a class="el" href="namespaceWorkStream_1_1internal_1_1tbb__no__coloring.html#a8673698a405bf47aa24002aeb6d76d70">run()</a> after combining the matrices for the current time-step.</p>

<p>This function is the interesting part of the program. It takes care of the adaptive mesh refinement. The three tasks this function performs is to first find out which cells to refine/coarsen, then to actually do the refinement and eventually transfer the solution vectors between the two different grids. The first task is simply achieved by using the well-established Kelly error estimator on the solution. The second task is to actually do the remeshing. That involves only basic functions as well, such as the <code>refine_and_coarsen_fixed_fraction</code> that refines those cells with the largest estimated error that together make up 60 per cent of the error, and coarsens those cells with the smallest error that make up for a combined 40 per cent of the error. Note that for problems such as the current one where the areas where something is going on are shifting around, we want to aggressively coarsen so that we can move cells around to where it is necessary. As already discussed in the introduction, too small a mesh leads to too small a time step, whereas too large a mesh leads to too little resolution. Consequently, after the first two steps, we have two loops that limit refinement and coarsening to an allowable range of cells:</p>

In the first loop, instead of calling <code><a class="el" href="namespaceTrilinosWrappers_1_1internal.html#aee42c8e3004e2e81eac3c3356d3ec46b">triangulation.end()</a></code> we may as well have called <code>triangulation.end_active(max_grid_level)</code> . The two calls should yield the same iterator since iterators are sorted by level and there should not be any cells on levels higher than on level <code>max_grid_level</code> . In fact, this very piece of code makes sure that this is the case.</p>
<p>As part of mesh refinement we need to transfer the solution vectors from the old mesh to the new one. To this end we use the <a class="el" href="classSolutionTransfer.html">SolutionTransfer</a> class and we have to prepare the solution vectors that should be transferred to the new grid (we will lose the old grid once we have done the refinement so the transfer has to happen concurrently with refinement). At the point where we call this function, we will have just computed the solution, so we no longer need the old_solution variable (it will be overwritten by the solution just after the mesh may have been refined, i.e., at the end of the time step; see below). In other words, we only need the one solution vector, and we copy it to a temporary object where it is safe from being reset when we further down below call <code>setup_system()</code> . Consequently, we initialize a <a class="el" href="classSolutionTransfer.html">SolutionTransfer</a> object by attaching it to the old DoF handler. We then prepare the triangulation and the data vector for refinement (in this order).</p>

Next, we actually perform the interpolation of the solution from old to new grid. The final step is to apply the hanging node constraints to the solution vector, i.e., to make sure that the values of degrees of freedom located on hanging nodes are so that the solution is continuous. This is necessary since <a class="el" href="classSolutionTransfer.html">SolutionTransfer</a> only operates on cells locally, without regard to the neighborhood.</p>

<p>This is the main driver of the program, where we loop over all time steps. At the top of the function, we set the number of initial global mesh refinements and the number of initial cycles of adaptive mesh refinement by repeating the first time step a few times. Then we create a mesh, initialize the various objects we will work with, set a label for where we should start when re-running the first time step, and interpolate the initial solution onto out mesh (we choose the zero function here, which of course we could do in a simpler way by just setting the solution vector to zero). We also output the initial time step once.</p>
<pre class="fragment">@note   If you're an experienced programmer, you may be surprised that we use a   &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt;   statement in this piece of code!   &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt;   statements are not particularly well liked any more since Edsgar Dijkstra, one of the greats of computer science, wrote a letter in 1968 called "Go To Statement considered harmful" (see &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Considered_harmful"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). The author of this code subscribes to this notion whole-heartedly:   &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt;   is hard to understand. In fact, deal.II contains virtually no occurrences: excluding code that was essentially transcribed from books and not counting duplicated code pieces, there are 3 locations in about 600,000 lines of code at the time this note is written; we also use it in 4 tutorial programs, in exactly the same context as here. Instead of trying to justify the occurrence here, let's first look at the code and we'll come back to the issue at the end of function.

</div>
<p> The movie shows how the two sources switch on and off and how the mesh reactsto this. It is quite obvious that the mesh as is is probably not the best wecould come up with. We'll get back to this in the next section.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="extensions"></a><a class="anchor" id="Possibilitiesforextensions"></a></p><h3>Possibilities for extensions</h3>
<p>There are at least two areas where one can improve this program significantly:adaptive time stepping and a better choice of the mesh. <a class="anchor" id="Adaptivetimestepping"></a></p><h4>Adaptive time stepping</h4>
<p>Having chosen an implicit time stepping scheme, we are not bound by anyCFL-like condition on the time step. Furthermore, because the time scales onwhich change happens on a given cell in the heat equation are not bound to thecells diameter (unlike the case with the wave equation, where we had a fixedspeed of information transport that couples the temporal and spatial scales),we can choose the time step as we please. Or, better, choose it as we deemnecessary for accuracy. Looking at the solution, it is clear that the action does not happen uniformlyover time: a lot is changing around the time we switch on a source, thingsbecome less dramatic once a source is on for a little while, and we enter along phase of decline when both sources are off. During these times, we couldsurely get away with a larger time step than before without sacrificing toomuch accuracy. The literature has many suggestions on how to choose the time step sizeadaptively. Much can be learned, for example, from the way ODE solvers choosetheir time steps. One can also be inspired by a posteriori error estimatorsthat can, ideally, be written in a way that the consist of a temporal and aspatial contribution to the overall error. If the temporal one is too large,we should choose a smaller time step. Ideas in this direction can be found,for example, in the PhD thesis of a former principal developer of deal.II,Ralf Hartmann, published by the University of Heidelberg, Germany, in 2002.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Bettertimesteppingmethods"></a></p><h4>Better time stepping methods</h4>
<p>We here use one of the simpler time stepping methods, namely the second orderin time Crank-Nicolson method. However, more accurate methods such asRunge-Kutta methods are available and should be used as they do not representmuch additional effort. It is not difficult to implement this for the currentprogram, but a more systematic treatment is also given in <a class="el" href="step_52.html">step-52</a> .</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Betterrefinementcriteria"></a></p><h4>Better refinement criteria</h4>
<p>If you look at the meshes in the movie above, it is clear that they are notparticularly well suited to the task at hand. In fact, they look ratherrandom. There are two factors at play. First, there are some islands where cellshave been refined but that are surrounded by non-refined cells (and thereare probably also a few occasional coarsened islands). These are not terrible,as they most of the time do not affect the approximation quality of the mesh,but they also don't help because so many of their additional degrees offreedom are in fact constrained by hanging node constraints. That said,this is easy to fix: the <a class="el" href="classTriangulation.html">Triangulation</a> class takes an argument to itsconstructor indicating a level of "mesh smoothing". Passing one of manypossible flags, this instructs the triangulation to refine some additionalcells, or not to refine some cells, so that the resulting mesh does not havethese artifacts. The second problem is more severe: the mesh appears to lag the solution.The underlying reason is that we only adapt the mesh once every fifthtime step, and only allow for a single refinement in these cases. Whenever asource switches on, the solution had been very smooth in this area before andthe mesh was consequently rather coarse. This implies that the next time stepwhen we refine the mesh, we will get one refinement level more in this area,and five time steps later another level, etc. But this is not enough: first,we should refine immediately when a source switches on (after all, in thecurrent context we at least know what the right hand side is), and we shouldallow for more than one refinement level. Of course, all of this can be doneusing deal.II, it just requires a bit of algorithmic thinking in how to makethis work!</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Positivitypreservation"></a></p><h4>Positivity preservation</h4>
<p>To increase the accuracy and resolution of your simulation in time, onetypically decreases the time step size \(k_n\) . If you start playing aroundwith the time step in this particular example, you will notice that thesolution becomes partly negative, if \(k_n\) is below a certain threshold.This is not what we would expect to happen (in nature). To get an idea of this behavior mathematically, let us consider a general,fully discrete problem: </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} A u^{n} = B u^{n-1}. \end{align*}
</p>
<p> The general form of the \(i\) th equation then reads: </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} a_{ii} u^{n}_i &amp;= b_{ii} u^{n-1}_i + \sum\limits_{j \in S_i} \left( b_{ij} u^{n-1}_j - a_{ij} u^{n}_j \right), \end{align*}
</p>
<p> where \(S_i\) is the set of degrees of freedom that DoF \(i\) couples with (i.e.,for which either the matrix \(A\) or matrix \(B\) has a nonzero entry at position \((i,j)\) ). If all coefficientsfulfill the following conditions: </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} a_{ii} &amp;&gt; 0, &amp; b_{ii} &amp;\geq 0, &amp; a_{ij} &amp;\leq 0, &amp; b_{ij} &amp;\geq 0, &amp; \forall j &amp;\in S_i, \end{align*}
</p>
<p> all solutions \(u^{n}\) keep their sign from the previous ones \(u^{n-1}\) , andconsequently from the initial values \(u^0\) . See e.g.<a href="http://bookstore.siam.org/cs14/">Kuzmin, H&auml;m&auml;l&auml;inen</a>for more information on positivity preservation. Depending on the PDE to solve and the time integration scheme used, one isable to deduce conditions for the time step \(k_n\) . For the heat equation withthe Crank-Nicolson scheme,<a href="https://doi.org/10.2478/cmam-2010-0025">Schatz et. al.</a> havetranslated it to the following ones: </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} (1 - \theta) k a_{ii} &amp;\leq m_{ii},\qquad \forall i, &amp; \theta k \left| a_{ij} \right| &amp;\geq m_{ij},\qquad j \neq i, \end{align*}
</p>
<p> where \(M = m_{ij}\) denotes the mass matrix and \(A = a_{ij}\) the stiffnessmatrix with \(a_{ij} \leq 0\) for \(j \neq i\) , respectively. With \(a_{ij} \leq 0\) , we can formulate bounds for the global time step \(k\) asfollows: </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} k_{\text{max}} &amp;= \frac{ 1 }{ 1 - \theta } \min\left( \frac{ m_{ii} }{ a_{ii} } \right),~ \forall i, &amp; k_{\text{min}} &amp;= \frac{ 1 }{ \theta } \max\left( \frac{ m_{ij} }{ \left|a_{ij}\right| } \right),~ j \neq i. \end{align*}
</p>
<p> In other words, the time step is constrained by <em>both a lower and upper bound</em> in case of a Crank-Nicolson scheme. These bounds should beconsidered along with the CFL condition to ensure significance of the performedsimulations. Being unable to make the time step as small as we want to get moreaccuracy without losing the positivity property is annoying. It raisesthe question of whether we can at least <em>compute</em> the minimal time stepwe can choose to ensure positivity preservation in this particular tutorial.Indeed, we can usethe <a class="el" href="classSparseMatrix.html">SparseMatrix</a> objects for both mass and stiffness that are created viathe <a class="el" href="namespaceMatrixCreator.html">MatrixCreator</a> functions. Iterating through each entry via SparseMatrixIteratorslets us check for diagonal and off-diagonal entries to set a proper time stepdynamically. For quadratic matrices, the diagonal element is stored as thefirst member of a row (see <a class="el" href="classSparseMatrix.html">SparseMatrix</a> documentation). An exemplary codesnippet on how to grab the entries of interest from the <code>mass_matrix</code> is shown below. </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"><a class="code" href="group__Exceptions.html#ga70a0bb353656e704acf927945277bbc6">Assert</a> (<a class="code" href="namespaceLocalIntegrators_1_1L2.html#a1c15243765304a803037988b5561627d">mass_matrix</a>.m() == <a class="code" href="namespaceLocalIntegrators_1_1L2.html#a1c15243765304a803037988b5561627d">mass_matrix</a>.n(), ExcNotQuadratic());</div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="keywordtype">unsigned</span> <span class="keywordtype">int</span> num_rows = <a class="code" href="namespaceLocalIntegrators_1_1L2.html#a1c15243765304a803037988b5561627d">mass_matrix</a>.m();</div><div class="line"><span class="keywordtype">double</span> mass_matrix_min_diag    = <a class="code" href="namespaceVectorTools_1_1EvaluationFlags.html#ac6721740e24732d6afabcf28ddfc1ffda8e7f5b8545162dccd5ed717792bdf420">std::numeric_limits&lt;double&gt;::max</a>(),</div><div class="line">       mass_matrix_max_offdiag = 0.;</div><div class="line">  </div><div class="line"><a class="code" href="classSparseMatrixIterators_1_1Iterator.html">SparseMatrixIterators::Iterator&lt;double,true&gt;</a> row_it (&amp;<a class="code" href="namespaceLocalIntegrators_1_1L2.html#a1c15243765304a803037988b5561627d">mass_matrix</a>, 0);</div><div class="line">  </div><div class="line"><span class="keywordflow">for</span>(<span class="keywordtype">unsigned</span> <span class="keywordtype">int</span> m = 0; m&lt;num_rows; ++m)</div><div class="line">{</div><div class="line">  <span class="comment">// check the diagonal element</span></div><div class="line">  row_it = <a class="code" href="namespaceLocalIntegrators_1_1L2.html#a1c15243765304a803037988b5561627d">mass_matrix</a>.begin(m);</div><div class="line">  mass_matrix_min_diag = <a class="code" href="namespaceVectorTools_1_1EvaluationFlags.html#ac6721740e24732d6afabcf28ddfc1ffdaeb244a97c0c9e9e7ca4765e096f0badc">std::min</a>(row_it-&gt;value(), mass_matrix_min_diag);</div><div class="line">  ++row_it;</div><div class="line">  </div><div class="line">  <span class="comment">// check the off-diagonal elements</span></div><div class="line">  <span class="keywordflow">for</span>(; row_it != <a class="code" href="namespaceLocalIntegrators_1_1L2.html#a1c15243765304a803037988b5561627d">mass_matrix</a>.end(m); ++row_it)</div><div class="line">    mass_matrix_max_offdiag = <a class="code" href="namespaceVectorTools_1_1EvaluationFlags.html#ac6721740e24732d6afabcf28ddfc1ffda8e7f5b8545162dccd5ed717792bdf420">std::max</a>(row_it-&gt;value(), mass_matrix_max_offdiag);</div><div class="line">}</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Using the information so computed, we can bound the time step via the formulasabove.</p>

<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The material presented here is also discussed in <a href="http://www.math.colostate.edu/~bangerth/videos.676.29.html">video lecture 29</a>, <a href="http://www.math.colostate.edu/~bangerth/videos.676.30.html">video lecture 30</a>. (All video lectures are also available <a href="http://www.math.colostate.edu/~bangerth/videos.html">here</a>.) （ See also <a href="http://www.math.colostate.edu/~bangerth/videos.676.31.7.html">video lecture 31.7</a>.) 。</dd></dl>
<p>这个程序实现了热方程</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} \frac{\partial u(\mathbf x, t)}{\partial t} - \Delta u(\mathbf x, t) &amp;= f(\mathbf x, t), \qquad\qquad &amp;&amp; \forall \mathbf x \in \Omega, t\in (0,T), \\ u(\mathbf x, 0) &amp;= u_0(\mathbf x) &amp;&amp; \forall \mathbf x \in \Omega, \\ \\ u(\mathbf x, t) &amp;= g(\mathbf x,t) &amp;&amp; \forall \mathbf x \in \partial\Omega, t \in (0,T). \end{align*}
</p>
<p>从某种意义上说，这个方程比我们在前面的程序步骤23、步骤24、步骤25中讨论的方程，即波浪方程要简单。这是由于热方程随着时间的推移使解变得平滑，因此在许多方面更宽容。例如，当使用隐式时间步长方法时，我们实际上可以采取大的时间步长，我们对通过每隔几步适应网格而引入的小干扰的麻烦较小，等等。</p>
<p>我们在这里的目标将是使用theta-scheme解决上述方程，该方程在时间上离散，使用以下方法，我们希望 \(u^n(\mathbf x)\) 在某个时间 \(t_n\) 近似 \(u(\mathbf x, t_n)\) 。</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} \frac{u^n(\mathbf x)-u^{n-1}(\mathbf x)}{k_n} - \left[ (1-\theta)\Delta u^{n-1}(\mathbf x) + \theta\Delta u^n(\mathbf x) \right] &amp;= \left[ (1-\theta)f(\mathbf x, t_{n-1}) + \theta f(\mathbf x, t_n) \right]. \end{align*}
</p>
<p>这里， \(k_n=t_n-t_{n-1}\) 是时间步长。Theta-scheme概括了显式欧拉（ \(\theta=0\) ）、隐式欧拉（ \(\theta=1\) ）和Crank-Nicolson（ \(\theta=\frac 12\) ）时间离散。由于后者具有最高的收敛顺序，我们将在下面的程序中选择 \(\theta=\frac 12\) ，但要使这个参数的操作保持简单。如果你对玩更高阶的方法感兴趣，可以看一下步骤52）。</p>
<p>鉴于这种时间离散化，空间离散化会像往常一样发生，通过与测试函数相乘，通过部分积分，然后将一切限制在一个有限维的子空间。在与 \(k_n\) 相乘之后，这就产生了以下一组完全离散的方程。</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} M U^n-MU^{n-1} + k_n \left[ (1-\theta)A U^{n-1} + \theta A U^n \right] &amp;= k_n \left[ (1-\theta)F^{n-1} + \theta F^n \right], \end{align*}
</p>
<p>其中 \(M\) 是质量矩阵， \(A\) 是将拉普拉斯离散化后的刚度矩阵。将所有已知的量带到右手边，就得到了我们在每一步都要解决的线性系统。</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} (M + k_n \theta A) U^n &amp;= MU^{n-1} - k_n (1-\theta)A U^{n-1} + k_n \left[ (1-\theta)F^{n-1} + \theta F^n \right]. \end{align*}
</p>
<p>左手边的线性系统是对称和正定的，所以我们用共轭梯度法解决它应该没有问题。</p>
<p>如果我们在初始时间有一组节点系数 \(U^0\) ，我们可以开始上面的迭代。在这里，我们采取的是将初始值 \(u_0(\mathbf x)\) 插值到用于第一个时间步长的网格上得到的那些。我们还需要选择一个时间步长；在这里我们只选择固定的时间步长，但显然先进的模拟器会希望自适应地选择它。我们将在<a href="#Results">results section below</a>中简要地回到这个问题。</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Adaptingmeshesfortimedependentproblems"></a></p><h3>Adapting meshes for time dependent problems </h3>
<p>在前面几个程序中求解波浪方程及其变体时，我们保持了固定的网格。就像静止方程一样，我们可以很好地说明这不是最聪明的方法，通过调整网格可以节省大量资金。然而，与静止的情况相比，还有很大的困难。让我们依次来看看这些困难。</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="startli"><em>Time step size and minimal mesh size</em> 。对于静止的问题，一般的做法是 "将网格做得越细越好"。对于有奇点的问题，这往往会导致我们在角落或界面上得到许多细化层次的情况。第一个使用自适应网格的教程，第6步，已经是一个案例的要点。</p>
<p>然而，对于时间相关问题，我们通常需要选择与网格大小相关的时间步长。对于显式时间离散，这是显而易见的，因为我们需要遵守一个CFL条件，将时间步长与最小的网格尺寸联系起来。对于隐式时间离散，不存在这样的硬性限制，但在实践中，如果我们使网格尺寸变小，我们仍然希望使时间步长变小，因为我们通常有 \(\|e\| \le {\cal O}(k^p + h^q)\) 形式的误差估计，其中 \(p,q\) 分别是时间和空间离散的收敛阶。我们只有减少这两个项，才能使误差变小。理想情况下，这样的估计会建议选择 \(k \propto h^{q/p}\) 。因为，至少对于非光滑解的问题来说，误差通常集中在网格尺寸最小的单元中，所以我们必须确实选择 \(k \propto h_{\text{min}}^{q/p}\) ，使用<em>smallest</em>网格尺寸。</p>
<p>其结果是，在一个地方进一步细化网格不仅意味着略微增加自由度数量的适度额外努力，而且由于时间步长较小，必须更频繁地求解<em>global</em>线性系统的更大努力。</p>
<p>在实践中，我们通常通过承认我们不能使时间步长任意地小，因此也不能使局部网格尺寸任意地小来处理这个问题。相反，我们设置了一个最大的细化水平，当我们标记单元进行细化时，我们只是不细化那些子单元会超过这个最大的细化水平。</p>
<p>还有一个类似的问题是，我们将选择一个右手边，在不同的时间在领域的不同部分开启。为了避免在突然需要更细的网格的地方，被太粗的网格弄得措手不及，我们还将在程序中强制执行<em>minimal</em>的网格细化水平。</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli"><em>Test functions from different meshes</em>。让我们再次考虑我们在上面写下的半离散方程。 </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} \frac{u^n(\mathbf x)-u^{n-1}(\mathbf x)}{k_n} - \left[ (1-\theta)\Delta u^{n-1}(\mathbf x) + \theta\Delta u^n(\mathbf x) \right] &amp;= \left[ (1-\theta)f(\mathbf x, t_{n-1}) + \theta f(\mathbf x, t_n) \right]. \end{align*}
</p>
<p>我们在这里可以把 \(u^{n-1}\) 视为数据，因为它可能已经被计算过了。现在，让我们替换掉 </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} u^n(\mathbf x)\approx u_h^n(\mathbf x) = \sum_j U^n \varphi_j(\mathbf x), \end{align*}
</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>与测试函数 \(\varphi_i(\mathbf x)\) 相乘，并在必要时按部分整合。在如上所述的过程中，这将产生 </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} \sum_j (M + k_n \theta A)_{ij} U^n_j &amp;= (\varphi_i, u_h^{n-1}) - k_n (1-\theta)(\nabla \varphi_i, \nabla u_h^{n-1}) + k_n \left[ (1-\theta)F^{n-1} + \theta F^n \right]. \end{align*}
</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>现在想象一下，我们在时间步骤 \(n-1\) 和 \(n\) 之间改变了网格。那么问题来了，我们在 \(u_h^n\) 和 \(u^{n-1}\) 中使用的基函数是不同的！这与右边的项有关。这与右手边的项有关，其中第一个项我们可以更清楚地写成（第二个项遵循同样的模式） </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} (\varphi_i, u_h^{n-1}) = (\varphi_i^n, u_h^{n-1}) = \sum_{j=1}^{N_{n-1}} (\varphi_i^n, \varphi_j^{n-1}) U^{n-1}_j, \qquad\qquad i=1\ldots N_n. \end{align*}
</p>
<p>如果在这两个时间步骤中使用的网格是相同的，那么 \((\varphi_i^n, \varphi_j^{n-1})\) 就会形成一个方形的质量矩阵 \(M_{ij}\) 。然而，如果网格不一样，那么一般来说，矩阵是矩形的。更糟的是，甚至很难计算这些积分，因为如果我们在时间步长 \(n\) 的网格单元上循环，那么我们需要在这些单元的正交点上评估 \(\varphi_j^{n-1}\) ，但它们不一定对应于时间步长 \(n-1\) 的网格单元，而且 \(\varphi_j^{n-1}\) 不是通过这些单元定义的；如果我们想通过对网格 \(n-1\) 的单元积分计算这些积分当然也是一样。</p>
<p>在任何情况下，我们必须面对的情况是，我们需要整合定义在两个不同网格上的形状函数。这是可以做到的，事实上在步骤28中也有演示，但这个过程最多只能用 "笨拙 "一词来形容。</p>
<p>在实践中，人们通常不希望这样做。相反，我们在每次调整网格的时候，通过从旧的网格插值到新的网格来避免整个情况。换句话说，我们不是解决上面的方程，而是解决 </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} \sum_j (M + k_n \theta A)_{ij} U^n_j &amp;= (\varphi_i, I_h^n u_h^{n-1}) - k_n (1-\theta)(\nabla \varphi_i, \nabla I_h^n u_h^{n-1}) + k_n \left[ (1-\theta)F^{n-1} + \theta F^n \right], \end{align*}
</p>
<p>的问题</p>
<p class="endli">其中 \(I_h^n\) 是对时间步骤 \(n\) 中使用的有限元空间的内插算子。这不是最佳的方法，因为它除了时间和空间离散化之外还引入了一个额外的误差，但这是一个务实的方法，使得做时间适应网格是可行的。 </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="anchor" id="WhatcouldpossiblygowrongVerifyingwhetherthecodeiscorrect"></a></p><h3>What could possibly go wrong? Verifying whether the code is correct </h3>
<p>在实现有限元代码时，通常有许多事情会出错。特别是对于时间相关问题，以下是常见的错误来源。</p>
<ul>
<li>时间积分，例如把涉及当前和前一个时间步骤的条款前面的系数弄错了（例如，把一个系数 \(\theta\) 混为 \(1-\theta\) ）。</li>
<li>处理右侧，例如忘记了 \(k_n\) 或 \(\theta\) 的系数。</li>
<li>对边界值处理不当，例如再次忘记了 \(k_n\) 或 \(\theta\) 的系数，或忘记了不仅对右手边而且对系统矩阵应用非零边界值。</li>
</ul>
<p>一个不太常见的问题是把初始条件弄错了，因为通常只要输出第一个时间步长就能看出它是错的。在任何情况下，为了验证代码的正确性，有一个测试协议是很有帮助的，它允许我们分别验证这些组件中的每一个。这意味着</p>
<ul>
<li>用非零初始条件但零右手边和边界值测试代码，并验证时间演化是否正确。</li>
<li>然后用零初始条件和边界值但非零的右手边进行测试，再次确保正确性。</li>
<li>最后，用零初始条件和右手边但非零边界值进行测试。</li>
</ul>
<p>这听起来很复杂，但幸运的是，对于像这里的无系数（或常数系数）的线性偏微分方程，有一个相当标准的协议，它基于以下观察：如果你选择一个正方形 \([0,1]^2\) 作为你的领域（或者，稍加修改，一个矩形），那么精确解可以写成</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} u(x,y,t) = a(t) \sin(n_x \pi x) \sin(n_y \pi y) \end{align*}
</p>
<p>有整数常数 \(n_x,n_y\) ），如果只有初始条件、右手边和边界值也都是 \(\sin(n_x \pi x) \sin(n_y \pi y)\) 的形式。这是由于函数 \(\sin(n_x \pi x) \sin(n_y \pi y)\) 是拉普拉斯算子的特征函数，允许我们以分析方式计算时间因子 \(a(t)\) 等东西，并因此与我们的数值结果进行比较。</p>
<p>作为一个例子，让我们考虑我们有 \(u_0(x,y)=\sin(n_x \pi x) \sin(n_x \pi y)\) 和 \(f(x,y,t)=0\) 的情况。通过上面对 \(u(x,y,t)\) 的形式的主张（ansatz），我们可以得到</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} -\Delta\right) u(x,y,t) &amp;= \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} -\Delta\right) a(t) \sin(n_x \pi x) \sin(n_y \pi y) \\ &amp;= \left(a&#39;(t) + (n_x^2+n_y^2)\pi^2 a(t) \right) \sin(n_x \pi x) \sin(n_y \pi y). \end{align*}
</p>
<p>为了使其等于 \(f(x,y,t)=0\) ，我们需要： 1.</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} a&#39;(t) + (n_x^2+n_y^2)\pi^2 a(t) = 0 \end{align*}
</p>
<p>并由于初始条件， \(a(0)=1\) 。这个微分方程可以被整合，得到</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} a(t) = - e^{-(n_x^2+n_y^2)\pi^2 t}. \end{align*}
</p>
<p>换句话说，如果初始条件是正弦的乘积，那么解的形状与正弦的乘积完全相同，它以已知的时间依赖性衰减到零。如果你有足够细的网格和足够小的时间步长，这一点是很容易测试的。</p>
<p>如果你把时间积分方案弄错了（例如，在各条款前面有错误的 \(\theta\) 或 \(k\) 的因子），通常会发生的情况是你没有得到正确的解的时间行为。仔细检查各种因素，直到你得到正确的行为。你可能还想验证一下，时间衰减率（例如，通过绘制固定点的解的值来确定）在你每次将时间步长或网格大小增加一倍或减少一半的时候，都不会增加。你知道这不是对边界条件或右手边的处理，因为这些都是零。</p>
<p>如果你已经如此验证了时间积分器的正确性，那么就拿右手边非零但初始条件为零的情况来说。 \(u_0(x,y)=0\) 和 \(f(x,y,t)=\sin(n_x \pi x) \sin(n_x \pi y)\) 。再来看看。</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} -\Delta\right) u(x,y,t) &amp;= \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} -\Delta\right) a(t) \sin(n_x \pi x) \sin(n_y \pi y) \\ &amp;= \left(a&#39;(t) + (n_x^2+n_y^2)\pi^2 a(t) \right) \sin(n_x \pi x) \sin(n_y \pi y), \end{align*}
</p>
<p>而要使其等于 \(f(x,y,t)\) ，我们需要的是</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} a&#39;(t) + (n_x^2+n_y^2)\pi^2 a(t) = 1 \end{align*}
</p>
<p>并由于初始条件， \(a(0)=0\) 。对这个方程进行时间积分，可以得到</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} a(t) = \frac{1}{(n_x^2+n_y^2)\pi^2} \left[ 1 - e^{-(n_x^2+n_y^2)\pi^2 t} \right]. \end{align*}
</p>
<p>同样，如果你在右手边的条款前面有 \(\theta\) 或 \(k\) 的错误因子，你将不会得到正确的解的时间行为，或者它将收敛到 \(\frac{1}{(n_x^2+n_y^2)\pi^2}\) 以外的最大值。</p>
<p>一旦我们验证了使用这个方案的时间积分和右手处理是正确的，我们就可以继续验证我们的边界值是否正确，使用非常类似的方法。</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Thetestcase"></a></p><h3>The testcase </h3>
<p>在一个简单的域上用一个简单的右手边求解热方程，几乎总是导致解非常无聊，因为它们很快就变得非常光滑，然后就不再有什么变化。相反，我们在这里用零迪里希特边界值和零初始条件在L形域上求解方程，但作为右手边我们选择</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} f(\mathbf x, t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \chi_1(\mathbf x) &amp; \text{if \(0\le t \le 0.2\tau\) or \(\tau\le t \le 1.2\tau\) or \(2\tau\le t \le 2.2\tau\), etc} \\ \chi_2(\mathbf x) &amp; \text{if \(0.5\le t \le 0.7\tau\) or \(1.5\tau\le t \le 1.7\tau\) or \(2.5\tau\le t \le 2.7\tau\), etc} \\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{array} \right. \end{align*}
</p>
<p>在这里。</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} \chi_1(\mathbf x) &amp;= \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \text{if \(x&gt;0.5\) and \(y&gt;-0.5\)} \\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{array} \right. \\ \chi_2(\mathbf x) &amp;= \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \text{if \(x&gt;-0.5\) and \(y&gt;0.5\)} \\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{array} \right. \end{align*}
</p>
<p>换句话说，在每一个长度为 \(\tau\) 的周期中，右手边首先在域1中闪烁，然后完全关闭，然后在域2中打开，然后再次完全关闭。通过<a href="#Results">results section</a>中显示的解决方案的小动画，这种模式可能是最好的观察。</p>
<p>如果你把热方程解释为寻找导电固体的空间和时间可变的温度分布，那么上面的测试案例相当于一个L形体，我们把边界保持在零温度，并在领域的两个部分交替加热。在加热的同时，这些地方的温度会上升，之后温度会扩散并再次减弱。这些初始条件的意义在于，它们为我们提供了一个在时间上（当源打开和关闭时）以及时间上（在再入角以及源作用区域的边缘和角落）都有奇点的解决方案。</p>

<p>The next piece is the declaration of the main class of this program. It follows the well trodden path of previous examples. If you have looked at <a class="el" href="step_6.html">step-6</a>, for example, the only thing worth noting here is that we need to build two matrices (the mass and Laplace matrix) and keep the current and previous time step's solution. We then also need to store the current time, the size of the time step, and the number of the current time step. The last of the member variables denotes the theta parameter discussed in the introduction that allows us to treat the explicit and implicit Euler methods as well as the Crank-Nicolson method and other generalizations all in one program.</p>
<p>As far as member functions are concerned, the only possible surprise is that the <code>refine_mesh</code> function takes arguments for the minimal and maximal mesh refinement level. The purpose of this is discussed in the introduction.</p>

<p>It is time now for the implementation of the main class. Let's start with the constructor which selects a linear element, a time step constant at 1/500 (remember that one period of the source on the right hand side was set to 0.2 above, so we resolve each period with 100 time steps) and chooses the Crank Nicolson method by setting \(\theta=1/2\).</p>

<p>The next function is the one that sets up the <a class="el" href="classDoFHandler.html">DoFHandler</a> object, computes the constraints, and sets the linear algebra objects to their correct sizes. We also compute the mass and Laplace matrix here by simply calling two functions in the library.</p>
<p>Note that we do not take the hanging node constraints into account when assembling the matrices (both functions have an <a class="el" href="classAffineConstraints.html">AffineConstraints</a> argument that defaults to an empty object). This is because we are going to condense the constraints in <a class="el" href="namespaceWorkStream_1_1internal_1_1tbb__no__coloring.html#a8673698a405bf47aa24002aeb6d76d70">run()</a> after combining the matrices for the current time-step.</p>

<p>This function is the interesting part of the program. It takes care of the adaptive mesh refinement. The three tasks this function performs is to first find out which cells to refine/coarsen, then to actually do the refinement and eventually transfer the solution vectors between the two different grids. The first task is simply achieved by using the well-established Kelly error estimator on the solution. The second task is to actually do the remeshing. That involves only basic functions as well, such as the <code>refine_and_coarsen_fixed_fraction</code> that refines those cells with the largest estimated error that together make up 60 per cent of the error, and coarsens those cells with the smallest error that make up for a combined 40 per cent of the error. Note that for problems such as the current one where the areas where something is going on are shifting around, we want to aggressively coarsen so that we can move cells around to where it is necessary.</p>
<p>As already discussed in the introduction, too small a mesh leads to too small a time step, whereas too large a mesh leads to too little resolution. Consequently, after the first two steps, we have two loops that limit refinement and coarsening to an allowable range of cells:</p>

In the first loop, instead of calling <code><a class="el" href="namespaceTrilinosWrappers_1_1internal.html#aee42c8e3004e2e81eac3c3356d3ec46b">triangulation.end()</a></code> we may as well have called <code>triangulation.end_active(max_grid_level)</code>. The two calls should yield the same iterator since iterators are sorted by level and there should not be any cells on levels higher than on level <code>max_grid_level</code>. In fact, this very piece of code makes sure that this is the case.</p>
<p>As part of mesh refinement we need to transfer the solution vectors from the old mesh to the new one. To this end we use the <a class="el" href="classSolutionTransfer.html">SolutionTransfer</a> class and we have to prepare the solution vectors that should be transferred to the new grid (we will lose the old grid once we have done the refinement so the transfer has to happen concurrently with refinement). At the point where we call this function, we will have just computed the solution, so we no longer need the old_solution variable (it will be overwritten by the solution just after the mesh may have been refined, i.e., at the end of the time step; see below). In other words, we only need the one solution vector, and we copy it to a temporary object where it is safe from being reset when we further down below call <code>setup_system()</code>.</p>
<p>Consequently, we initialize a <a class="el" href="classSolutionTransfer.html">SolutionTransfer</a> object by attaching it to the old DoF handler. We then prepare the triangulation and the data vector for refinement (in this order).</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><a class="code" href="classSolutionTransfer.html">SolutionTransfer&lt;dim&gt;</a> solution_trans(dof_handler);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><a class="code" href="classVector.html">Vector&lt;double&gt;</a> previous_solution;</div><div class="line">previous_solution = solution;</div><div class="line">triangulation.<a class="code" href="classTriangulation.html#ab9fa3177e0e43ab0cf243215d284a35a">prepare_coarsening_and_refinement</a>();</div><div class="line">solution_trans.prepare_for_coarsening_and_refinement(previous_solution);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Now everything is ready, so do the refinement and recreate the DoF structure on the new grid, and finally initialize the matrix structures and the new vectors in the <code>setup_system</code> function. Next, we actually perform the interpolation of the solution from old to new grid. The final step is to apply the hanging node constraints to the solution vector, i.e., to make sure that the values of degrees of freedom located on hanging nodes are so that the solution is continuous. This is necessary since <a class="el" href="classSolutionTransfer.html">SolutionTransfer</a> only operates on cells locally, without regard to the neighborhood.</p>

<p>This is the main driver of the program, where we loop over all time steps. At the top of the function, we set the number of initial global mesh refinements and the number of initial cycles of adaptive mesh refinement by repeating the first time step a few times. Then we create a mesh, initialize the various objects we will work with, set a label for where we should start when re-running the first time step, and interpolate the initial solution onto out mesh (we choose the zero function here, which of course we could do in a simpler way by just setting the solution vector to zero). We also output the initial time step once.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>If you're an experienced programmer, you may be surprised that we use a <code>goto</code> statement in this piece of code! <code>goto</code> statements are not particularly well liked any more since Edsgar Dijkstra, one of the greats of computer science, wrote a letter in 1968 called "Go To Statement considered harmful" (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Considered_harmful">here</a>). The author of this code subscribes to this notion whole-heartedly: <code>goto</code> is hard to understand. In fact, deal.II contains virtually no occurrences: excluding code that was essentially transcribed from books and not counting duplicated code pieces, there are 3 locations in about 600,000 lines of code at the time this note is written; we also use it in 4 tutorial programs, in exactly the same context as here. Instead of trying to justify the occurrence here, let's first look at the code and we'll come back to the issue at the end of function.</dd></dl>

In essence, what the code does is something like this: </p><div class="CodeFragmentInTutorialComment"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keywordtype">void</span> <a class="code" href="namespaceWorkStream_1_1internal_1_1tbb__no__coloring.html#a8673698a405bf47aa24002aeb6d76d70">run</a> ()</div><div class="line">{</div><div class="line">  initialize;</div><div class="line">start_time_iteration:</div><div class="line">  <span class="keywordflow">for</span> (timestep=1...)</div><div class="line">  {</div><div class="line">     solve timestep;</div><div class="line">     <span class="keywordflow">if</span> (timestep==1 &amp;&amp; not happy with the result)</div><div class="line">     {</div><div class="line">       adjust some data structures;</div><div class="line">       <span class="keywordflow">goto</span> start_time_iteration; <span class="comment">// simply try again</span></div><div class="line">     }</div><div class="line">     postprocess;</div><div class="line">  }</div><div class="line">}</div></div><!-- fragment --> </div><p> Here, the condition "happy with the result" is whether we'd like to keep the current mesh or would rather refine the mesh and start over on the new mesh. We could of course replace the use of the <code>goto</code> by the following: </p><div class="CodeFragmentInTutorialComment"> <div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keywordtype">void</span> <a class="code" href="namespaceWorkStream_1_1internal_1_1tbb__no__coloring.html#a8673698a405bf47aa24002aeb6d76d70">run</a> ()</div><div class="line">{</div><div class="line">  initialize;</div><div class="line">  <span class="keywordflow">while</span> (<span class="keyword">true</span>)</div><div class="line">  {</div><div class="line">     solve timestep;</div><div class="line">     <span class="keywordflow">if</span> (not happy with the result)</div><div class="line">        adjust some data structures;</div><div class="line">     <span class="keywordflow">else</span></div><div class="line">        <span class="keywordflow">break</span>;</div><div class="line">  }</div><div class="line">  postprocess;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  <span class="keywordflow">for</span> (timestep=2...)</div><div class="line">  {</div><div class="line">     solve timestep;</div><div class="line">     postprocess;</div><div class="line">  }</div><div class="line">}</div></div><!-- fragment --> </div><p> This has the advantage of getting rid of the <code>goto</code> but the disadvantage of having to duplicate the code that implements the "solve timestep" and "postprocess" operations in two different places. This could be countered by putting these parts of the code (sizable chunks in the actual implementation above) into their own functions, but a <code>while(true)</code> loop with a <code>break</code> statement is not really all that much easier to read or understand than a <code>goto</code>.</p>
<p>In the end, one might simply agree that <em>in general</em> <code>goto</code> statements are a bad idea but be pragmatic and state that there may be occasions where they can help avoid code duplication and awkward control flow. This may be one of these places, and it matches the position Steve McConnell takes in his excellent book "Code Complete" <b>[CodeComplete]</b> about good programming practices (see the mention of this book in the introduction of <a class="el" href="step_1.html">step-1</a>) that spends a surprising ten pages on the question of <code>goto</code> in general.</p>

<p>这部电影显示了两个信号源是如何开启和关闭的，以及网格对此的反应。很明显，现在的网格可能不是我们能想出的最好的。我们将在下一节再来讨论这个问题。</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="extensions"></a></p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Possibilitiesforextensions"></a></p><h3>Possibilities for extensions</h3>
<p>至少有两个方面可以大大改善这个程序：自适应时间步长和更好地选择网格。</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Adaptivetimestepping"></a></p><h4>Adaptive time stepping</h4>
<p>由于选择了隐式时间步进方案，我们不受任何类似CFL的时间步进条件的约束。此外，由于在热力方程中发生变化的时间尺度不受细胞直径的约束（与波浪方程的情况不同，在波浪方程中我们有一个固定的信息传输速度，将时间尺度和空间尺度联系起来），我们可以随意选择时间步长。或者，最好是按照我们认为必要的准确性来选择它。</p>
<p>看一下解决方案，很明显，行动并不是随时间均匀发生的：在我们打开一个源的时候，很多东西都在发生变化，一旦一个源开启了一段时间，事情就变得不那么戏剧化了，而当两个源都关闭的时候，我们进入了一个漫长的下降阶段。在这些时候，我们肯定可以在不牺牲太多精确度的情况下，采用比以前更大的时间步长。</p>
<p>文献中有许多关于如何自适应地选择时间步长的建议。例如，可以从ODE求解器选择其时间步长的方式中学到很多。我们也可以从后验误差估计中得到启发，理想情况下，后验误差估计可以写成由对整体误差的时间和空间贡献组成。如果时间上的贡献太大，我们应该选择一个较小的时间步长。例如，这个方向的想法可以在deal.II的前主要开发者Ralf Hartmann的博士论文中找到，该论文由德国海德堡大学在2002年出版。</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Bettertimesteppingmethods"></a></p><h4>Better time stepping methods</h4>
<p>我们在这里使用了一种比较简单的时间步进方法，即二阶时间的Crank-Nicolson方法。然而，更精确的方法如Runge-Kutta方法是可用的，并且应该使用，因为它们并不代表很多额外的努力。对于目前的程序来说，实现这一点并不困难，但在<a class="el" href="step_52.html">step-52</a>中也给出了一个更系统的处理。</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Betterrefinementcriteria"></a></p><h4>Better refinement criteria</h4>
<p>如果你看一下上面电影中的网格，很明显，它们不是特别适合手头的任务。事实上，它们看起来相当随意。</p>
<p>有两个因素在起作用。首先，有一些岛屿，其中的单元已经被细化，但周围是未细化的单元（可能还有一些偶尔被粗化的岛屿）。这些并不可怕，因为它们大多数时候并不影响网格的近似质量，但是它们也没有帮助，因为它们的许多额外的自由度事实上受到悬挂节点约束的限制。也就是说，这很容易解决：Triangulation类在其构造函数中接受一个参数，表示 "网格平滑 "的程度。传递许多可能的标志之一，这将指示三角剖分细化一些额外的单元，或者不细化一些单元，这样得到的网格就不会有这些伪影。</p>
<p>第二个问题更为严重：网格似乎滞后于解。其根本原因是我们每隔五步才调整一次网格，而且在这些情况下只允许进行一次细化。每当一个源打开时，之前的解在这个区域是非常平滑的，因此网格也是相当粗糙的。这意味着在下一个时间步骤中，当我们细化网格时，我们会在这个区域多得到一个细化级别，五个时间步骤后再多一个级别，等等。但这还不够：首先，我们应该在一个源打开时立即进行细化（毕竟在当前情况下，我们至少知道右手边是什么），而且我们应该允许超过一个细化级别。当然，所有这些都可以用deal.II来完成，只是需要在如何使其发挥作用方面有一些算法上的思考!</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Positivitypreservation"></a></p><h4>Positivity preservation</h4>
<p>为了提高你的模拟在时间上的准确性和分辨率，通常会减少时间步长 \(k_n\) 。如果你在这个特定的例子中开始玩弄时间步长，你会注意到，如果 \(k_n\) 低于某个阈值，解决方案会变成部分负数。这不是我们所期望发生的（在自然界）。</p>
<p>为了从数学上了解这种行为，让我们考虑一个一般的、完全离散的问题。</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} A u^{n} = B u^{n-1}. \end{align*}
</p>
<p>那么 \(i\) th方程的一般形式为：。</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} a_{ii} u^{n}_i &amp;= b_{ii} u^{n-1}_i + \sum\limits_{j \in S_i} \left( b_{ij} u^{n-1}_j - a_{ij} u^{n}_j \right), \end{align*}
</p>
<p>其中 \(S_i\) 是与DoF \(i\) 耦合的自由度集合（即矩阵 \(A\) 或矩阵 \(B\) 在位置 \((i,j)\) 有一个非零条目）。如果所有系数都满足以下条件。</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} a_{ii} &amp;&gt; 0, &amp; b_{ii} &amp;\geq 0, &amp; a_{ij} &amp;\leq 0, &amp; b_{ij} &amp;\geq 0, &amp; \forall j &amp;\in S_i, \end{align*}
</p>
<p>所有的解决方案 \(u^{n}\) 都保持其与之前的解决方案 \(u^{n-1}\) 的符号，因此也保持其与初始值 \(u^0\) 的符号。关于正性保留的更多信息，请参见例如 <a href="http://bookstore.siam.org/cs14/">Kuzmin, H&auml;m&auml;l&auml;inen</a> 。</p>
<p>根据要解决的PDE和使用的时间积分方案，人们能够推导出时间步长的条件 \(k_n\) 。对于采用Crank-Nicolson方案的热方程，<a href="https://doi.org/10.2478/cmam-2010-0025">Schatz et. al.</a>已将其转化为下列方案。</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} (1 - \theta) k a_{ii} &amp;\leq m_{ii},\qquad \forall i, &amp; \theta k \left| a_{ij} \right| &amp;\geq m_{ij},\qquad j \neq i, \end{align*}
</p>
<p>其中 \(M = m_{ij}\) 表示质量矩阵， \(A = a_{ij}\) 表示刚度矩阵， \(a_{ij} \leq 0\) 分别表示 \(j \neq i\) 。有了 \(a_{ij} \leq 0\) ，我们可以制定全局时间步长 \(k\) 的界限如下。</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align*} k_{\text{max}} &amp;= \frac{ 1 }{ 1 - \theta } \min\left( \frac{ m_{ii} }{ a_{ii} } \right),~ \forall i, &amp; k_{\text{min}} &amp;= \frac{ 1 }{ \theta } \max\left( \frac{ m_{ij} }{ \left|a_{ij}\right| } \right),~ j \neq i. \end{align*}
</p>
<p>换句话说，在Crank-Nicolson方案的情况下，时间步长受到<em>both a lower and upper bound</em>的限制。这些约束应与CFL条件一起考虑，以确保所进行的模拟的重要性。</p>
<p>无法使时间步长达到我们想要的小，以获得更多的精度，而又不失去积极性属性，这是令人讨厌的。这就提出了一个问题：在这个特定的教程中，我们是否至少可以<em>compute</em>选择最小的时间步长来确保正性的保留。事实上，我们可以使用通过MatrixCreator函数创建的质量和刚度的SparseMatrix对象。通过SparseMatrixIterators遍历每个条目，我们可以检查对角线和非对角线条目，从而动态地设置一个合适的时间步长。对于二次元矩阵，对角线元素被存储为一行的第一个成员（见SparseMatrix文档）。下面是一个关于如何从 <code>mass_matrix</code> 中抓取感兴趣的条目的示范性代码片断。</p>
