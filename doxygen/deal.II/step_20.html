<p>This program is devoted to two aspects: the use of mixed finite elements &ndash; in particular Raviart-Thomas elements &ndash; and using block matrices to define solvers, preconditioners, and nested versions of those that use the substructure of the system matrix. The equation we are going to solve is again the Poisson equation, though with a matrix-valued coefficient: </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} -\nabla \cdot K({\mathbf x}) \nabla p &amp;=&amp; f \qquad {\textrm{in}\ } \Omega, \\ p &amp;=&amp; g \qquad {\textrm{on}\ }\partial\Omega. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> \(K({\mathbf x})\) is assumed to be uniformly positive definite, i.e., there is \(\alpha&gt;0\) such that the eigenvalues \(\lambda_i({\mathbf x})\) of \(K(x)\) satisfy \(\lambda_i({\mathbf x})\ge \alpha\). The use of the symbol \(p\) instead of the usual \(u\) for the solution variable will become clear in the next section.</p>
<p>After discussing the equation and the formulation we are going to use to solve it, this introduction will cover the use of block matrices and vectors, the definition of solvers and preconditioners, and finally the actual test case we are going to solve.</p>
<p>We are going to extend this tutorial program in <a class="el" href="step_21.html">step-21</a> to solve not only the mixed Laplace equation, but add another equation that describes the transport of a mixture of two fluids.</p>
<p>The equations covered here fall into the class of vector-valued problems. A toplevel overview of this topic can be found in the <a class="el" href="group__vector__valued.html">Handling vector valued problems</a> module.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Theequations"></a></p><h3>The equations</h3>
<p>In the form above, the Poisson equation (i.e., the Laplace equation with a nonzero right hand side) is generally considered a good model equation for fluid flow in porous media. Of course, one typically models fluid flow through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations">Navier-Stokes equations</a> or, if fluid velocities are slow or the viscosity is large, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes_flow">Stokes equations</a> (which we cover in <a class="el" href="step_22.html">step-22</a>). In the first of these two models, the forces that act are inertia and viscous friction, whereas in the second it is only viscous friction &ndash; i.e., forces that one fluid particle exerts on a nearby one. This is appropriate if you have free flow in a large domain, say a pipe, a river, or in the air. On the other hand, if the fluid is confined in pores, then friction forces exerted by the pore walls on the fluid become more and more important and internal viscous friction becomes less and less important. Modeling this then first leads to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy%27s_law#Brinkman_form_of_Darcy&apos;s_law">Brinkman model</a> if both effects are important, and in the limit of very small pores to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy%27s_law">Darcy equations</a>. The latter is just a different name for the Poisson or Laplace equation, connotating it with the area to which one wants to apply it: slow flow in a porous medium. In essence it says that the velocity is proportional to the negative pressure gradient that drives the fluid through the porous medium.</p>
<p>The Darcy equation models this pressure that drives the flow. (Because the solution variable is a pressure, we here use the name \(p\) instead of the name \(u\) more commonly used for the solution of partial differential equations.) Typical applications of this view of the Laplace equation are then modeling groundwater flow, or the flow of hydrocarbons in oil reservoirs. In these applications, \(K\) is the permeability tensor, i.e., a measure for how much resistance the soil or rock matrix asserts on the fluid flow.</p>
<p>In the applications named above, a desirable feature for a numerical scheme is that it should be locally conservative, i.e., that whatever flows into a cell also flows out of it (or the difference is equal to the integral over the source terms over each cell, if the sources are nonzero). However, as it turns out, the usual discretizations of the Laplace equation (such as those used in <a class="el" href="step_3.html">step-3</a>, <a class="el" href="step_4.html">step-4</a>, or <a class="el" href="step_6.html">step-6</a>) do not satisfy this property. But, one can achieve this by choosing a different formulation of the problem and a particular combination of finite element spaces.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Formulationweakformanddiscreteproblem"></a></p><h3>Formulation, weak form, and discrete problem</h3>
<p>To this end, one first introduces a second variable, called the velocity, \({\mathbf u}=-K\nabla p\). By its definition, the velocity is a vector in the negative direction of the pressure gradient, multiplied by the permeability tensor. If the permeability tensor is proportional to the unit matrix, this equation is easy to understand and intuitive: the higher the permeability, the higher the velocity; and the velocity is proportional to the gradient of the pressure, going from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure (thus the negative sign).</p>
<p>With this second variable, one then finds an alternative version of the Laplace equation, called the <em>mixed formulation</em>: </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} K^{-1} {\mathbf u} + \nabla p &amp;=&amp; 0 \qquad {\textrm{in}\ } \Omega, \\ -{\textrm{div}}\ {\mathbf u} &amp;=&amp; -f \qquad {\textrm{in}\ }\Omega, \\ p &amp;=&amp; g \qquad {\textrm{on}\ } \partial\Omega. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> Here, we have multiplied the equation defining the velocity \({\mathbf u}\) by \(K^{-1}\) because this makes the set of equations symmetric: one of the equations has the gradient, the second the negative divergence, and these two are of course adjoints of each other, resulting in a symmetric bilinear form and a consequently symmetric system matrix under the common assumption that \(K\) is a symmetric tensor.</p>
<p>The weak formulation of this problem is found by multiplying the two equations with test functions and integrating some terms by parts: </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} A(\{{\mathbf u},p\},\{{\mathbf v},q\}) = F(\{{\mathbf v},q\}), \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> where </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} A(\{{\mathbf u},p\},\{{\mathbf v},q\}) &amp;=&amp; ({\mathbf v}, K^{-1}{\mathbf u})_\Omega - ({\textrm{div}}\ {\mathbf v}, p)_\Omega - (q,{\textrm{div}}\ {\mathbf u})_\Omega \\ F(\{{\mathbf v},q\}) &amp;=&amp; -(g,{\mathbf v}\cdot {\mathbf n})_{\partial\Omega} - (f,q)_\Omega. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> Here, \({\mathbf n}\) is the outward normal vector at the boundary. Note how in this formulation, Dirichlet boundary values of the original problem are incorporated in the weak form.</p>
<p>To be well-posed, we have to look for solutions and test functions in the space \(H({\textrm{div}})=\{{\mathbf w}\in L^2(\Omega)^d:\ {\textrm{div}}\ {\mathbf w}\in L^2\}\) for \(\mathbf u\), \(\mathbf v\), and \(L^2\) for \(p,q\). It is a well-known fact stated in almost every book on finite element theory that if one chooses discrete finite element spaces for the approximation of \({\mathbf u},p\) inappropriately, then the resulting discrete problem is instable and the discrete solution will not converge to the exact solution. (Some details on the problem considered here &ndash; which falls in the class of "saddle-point problems" &ndash; can be found on the Wikipedia page on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladyzhenskaya%E2%80%93Babu%C5%A1ka%E2%80%93Brezzi_condition">Ladyzhenskaya-Babuska-Brezzi (LBB) condition</a>.)</p>
<p>To overcome this, a number of different finite element pairs for \({\mathbf u},p\) have been developed that lead to a stable discrete problem. One such pair is to use the Raviart-Thomas spaces \(RT(k)\) for the velocity \({\mathbf u}\) and discontinuous elements of class \(DQ(k)\) for the pressure \(p\). For details about these spaces, we refer in particular to the book on mixed finite element methods by Brezzi and Fortin, but many other books on the theory of finite elements, for example the classic book by Brenner and Scott, also state the relevant results. In any case, with appropriate choices of function spaces, the discrete formulation reads as follows: Find \({\mathbf u}_h,p_h\) so that </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} A(\{{\mathbf u}_h,p_h\},\{{\mathbf v}_h,q_h\}) = F(\{{\mathbf v}_h,q_h\}) \qquad\qquad \forall {\mathbf v}_h,q_h. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p>Before continuing, let us briefly pause and show that the choice of function spaces above provides us with the desired local conservation property. In particular, because the pressure space consists of discontinuous piecewise polynomials, we can choose the test function \(q\) as the function that is equal to one on any given cell \(K\) and zero everywhere else. If we also choose \({\mathbf v}=0\) everywhere (remember that the weak form above has to hold for <em>all</em> discrete test functions \(q,v\)), then putting these choices of test functions into the weak formulation above implies in particular that </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} - (1,{\textrm{div}}\ {\mathbf u}_h)_K = -(1,f)_K, \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> which we can of course write in more explicit form as </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} \int_K {\textrm{div}}\ {\mathbf u}_h = \int_K f. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> Applying the divergence theorem results in the fact that \({\mathbf u}_h\) has to satisfy, for every choice of cell \(K\), the relationship </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} \int_{\partial K} {\mathbf u}_h\cdot{\mathbf n} = \int_K f. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> If you now recall that \({\mathbf u}\) was the velocity, then the integral on the left is exactly the (discrete) flux across the boundary of the cell \(K\). The statement is then that the flux must be equal to the integral over the sources within \(K\). In particular, if there are no sources (i.e., \(f=0\) in \(K\)), then the statement is that <em>total</em> flux is zero, i.e., whatever flows into a cell must flow out of it through some other part of the cell boundary. This is what we call <em>local conservation</em> because it holds for every cell.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the usual continuous \(Q_k\) elements would not result in this kind of property when used for the pressure (as, for example, we do in <a class="el" href="step_43.html">step-43</a>) because one can not choose a discrete test function \(q_h\) that is one on a cell \(K\) and zero everywhere else: It would be discontinuous and consequently not in the finite element space. (Strictly speaking, all we can say is that the proof above would not work for continuous elements. Whether these elements might still result in local conservation is a different question as one could think that a different kind of proof might still work; in reality, however, the property really does not hold.)</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Assemblingthelinearsystem"></a></p><h3>Assembling the linear system</h3>
<p>The deal.II library (of course) implements Raviart-Thomas elements \(RT(k)\) of arbitrary order \(k\), as well as discontinuous elements \(DG(k)\). If we forget about their particular properties for a second, we then have to solve a discrete problem </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} A(x_h,w_h) = F(w_h), \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> with the bilinear form and right hand side as stated above, and \(x_h=\{{\mathbf u}_h,p_h\}\), \(w_h=\{{\mathbf v}_h,q_h\}\). Both \(x_h\) and \(w_h\) are from the space \(X_h=RT(k)\times DQ(k)\), where \(RT(k)\) is itself a space of \(dim\)-dimensional functions to accommodate for the fact that the flow velocity is vector-valued. The necessary question then is: how do we do this in a program?</p>
<p>Vector-valued elements have already been discussed in previous tutorial programs, the first time and in detail in <a class="el" href="step_8.html">step-8</a>. The main difference there was that the vector-valued space \(V_h\) is uniform in all its components: the \(dim\) components of the displacement vector are all equal and from the same function space. What we could therefore do was to build \(V_h\) as the outer product of the \(dim\) times the usual \(Q(1)\) finite element space, and by this make sure that all our shape functions have only a single non-zero vector component. Instead of dealing with vector-valued shape functions, all we did in <a class="el" href="step_8.html">step-8</a> was therefore to look at the (scalar) only non-zero component and use the <code>fe.system_to_component_index(i).first</code> call to figure out which component this actually is.</p>
<p>This doesn't work with Raviart-Thomas elements: following from their construction to satisfy certain regularity properties of the space \(H({\textrm{div}})\), the shape functions of \(RT(k)\) are usually nonzero in all their vector components at once. For this reason, were <code>fe.system_to_component_index(i).first</code> applied to determine the only nonzero component of shape function \(i\), an exception would be generated. What we really need to do is to get at <em>all</em> vector components of a shape function. In deal.II diction, we call such finite elements <em>non-primitive</em>, whereas finite elements that are either scalar or for which every vector-valued shape function is nonzero only in a single vector component are called <em>primitive</em>.</p>
<p>So what do we have to do for non-primitive elements? To figure this out, let us go back in the tutorial programs, almost to the very beginnings. There, we learned that we use the <code><a class="el" href="classFEValues.html">FEValues</a></code> class to determine the values and gradients of shape functions at quadrature points. For example, we would call <code>fe_values.shape_value(i,q_point)</code> to obtain the value of the <code>i</code>th shape function on the quadrature point with number <code>q_point</code>. Later, in <a class="el" href="step_8.html">step-8</a> and other tutorial programs, we learned that this function call also works for vector-valued shape functions (of primitive finite elements), and that it returned the value of the only non-zero component of shape function <code>i</code> at quadrature point <code>q_point</code>.</p>
<p>For non-primitive shape functions, this is clearly not going to work: there is no single non-zero vector component of shape function <code>i</code>, and the call to <code>fe_values.shape_value(i,q_point)</code> would consequently not make much sense. However, deal.II offers a second function call, <code>fe_values.shape_value_component(i,q_point,comp)</code> that returns the value of the <code>comp</code>th vector component of shape function <code>i</code> at quadrature point <code>q_point</code>, where <code>comp</code> is an index between zero and the number of vector components of the present finite element; for example, the element we will use to describe velocities and pressures is going to have \(dim+1\) components. It is worth noting that this function call can also be used for primitive shape functions: it will simply return zero for all components except one; for non-primitive shape functions, it will in general return a non-zero value for more than just one component.</p>
<p>We could now attempt to rewrite the bilinear form above in terms of vector components. For example, in 2d, the first term could be rewritten like this (note that \(u_0=x_0, u_1=x_1, p=x_2\)): </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} ({\mathbf u}_h^i, K^{-1}{\mathbf u}_h^j) = &amp;\left((x_h^i)_0, K^{-1}_{00} (x_h^j)_0\right) + \left((x_h^i)_0, K^{-1}_{01} (x_h^j)_1\right) + \\ &amp;\left((x_h^i)_1, K^{-1}_{10} (x_h^j)_0\right) + \left((x_h^i)_1, K^{-1}_{11} (x_h^j)_1\right). \end{eqnarray*}

<p>What this piece of code does is, given an <code>fe_values</code> object, to extract the values of the first \(dim\) components of shape function <code>i</code> at quadrature points <code>q</code>, that is the velocity components of that shape function. Put differently, if we write shape functions \(x_h^i\) as the tuple \(\{{\mathbf u}_h^i,p_h^i\}\), then the function returns the velocity part of this tuple. Note that the velocity is of course a <code>dim</code>-dimensional tensor, and that the function returns a corresponding object. Similarly, where we subscript with the pressure extractor, we extract the scalar pressure component. The whole mechanism is described in more detail in the <a class="el" href="group__vector__valued.html">Handling vector valued problems</a> module.</p>
<p>In practice, it turns out that we can do a bit better if we evaluate the shape functions, their gradients and divergences only once per outermost loop, and store the result, as this saves us a few otherwise repeated computations (it is possible to save even more repeated operations by calculating all relevant quantities in advance and then only inserting the results in the actual loop, see <a class="el" href="step_22.html">step-22</a> for a realization of that approach).

<p><a class="anchor" id="Linearsolversandpreconditioners"></a></p><h3>Linear solvers and preconditioners</h3>
<p>After assembling the linear system we are faced with the task of solving it. The problem here is that the matrix possesses two undesirable properties:</p><ul>
<li>It is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness_of_a_matrix">indefinite</a>, i.e., it has both positive and negative eigenvalues. We don't want to prove this property here, but note that this is true for all matrices of the form \(\left(\begin{array}{cc} M &amp; B \\ B^T &amp; 0 \end{array}\right)\) such as the one here where \(M\) is positive definite.</li>
<li>The matrix has a zero block at the bottom right (there is no term in the bilinear form that couples the pressure \(p\) with the pressure test function \(q\)).</li>
</ul>
<p>At least it is symmetric, but the first issue above still means that the Conjugate Gradient method is not going to work since it is only applicable to problems in which the matrix is symmetric and positive definite. We would have to resort to other iterative solvers instead, such as MinRes, SymmLQ, or GMRES, that can deal with indefinite systems. However, then the next problem immediately surfaces: Due to the zero block, there are zeros on the diagonal and none of the usual, "simple" preconditioners (Jacobi, SSOR) will work as they require division by diagonal elements.</p>
<p>For the matrix sizes we expect to run with this program, the by far simplest approach would be to just use a direct solver (in particular, the <a class="el" href="classSparseDirectUMFPACK.html">SparseDirectUMFPACK</a> class that is bundled with deal.II). <a class="el" href="step_29.html">step-29</a> goes this route and shows that solving <em>any</em> linear system can be done in just 3 or 4 lines of code.</p>
<p>But then, this is a tutorial: We teach how to do things. Consequently, in the following, we will introduce some techniques that can be used in cases like these. Namely, we will consider the linear system as not consisting of one large matrix and vectors, but we will want to decompose matrices into <em>blocks</em> that correspond to the individual operators that appear in the system. We note that the resulting solver is not optimal &ndash; there are much better ways to efficiently compute the system, for example those explained in the results section of <a class="el" href="step_22.html">step-22</a> or the one we use in <a class="el" href="step_43.html">step-43</a> for a problem similar to the current one. Here, our goal is simply to introduce new solution techniques and how they can be implemented in deal.II.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="SolvingusingtheSchurcomplement"></a></p><h4>Solving using the Schur complement</h4>
<p>In view of the difficulties using standard solvers and preconditioners mentioned above, let us take another look at the matrix. If we sort our degrees of freedom so that all velocity come before all pressure variables, then we can subdivide the linear system \(Ax=b\) into the following blocks: </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} \left(\begin{array}{cc} M &amp; B \\ B^T &amp; 0 \end{array}\right) \left(\begin{array}{cc} U \\ P \end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{cc} F \\ G \end{array}\right), \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> where \(U,P\) are the values of velocity and pressure degrees of freedom, respectively, \(M\) is the mass matrix on the velocity space, \(B^T\) corresponds to the negative divergence operator, and \(B\) is its transpose and corresponds to the gradient.</p>
<p>By block elimination, we can then re-order this system in the following way (multiply the first row of the system by \(B^TM^{-1}\) and then subtract the second row from it): </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} B^TM^{-1}B P &amp;=&amp; B^TM^{-1} F - G, \\ MU &amp;=&amp; F - BP. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> Here, the matrix \(S=B^TM^{-1}B\) (called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schur_complement">Schur complement</a> of \(A\)) is obviously symmetric and, owing to the positive definiteness of \(M\) and the fact that \(B\) has full column rank, \(S\) is also positive definite.</p>
<p>Consequently, if we could compute \(S\), we could apply the Conjugate Gradient method to it. However, computing \(S\) is expensive because it requires us to compute the inverse of the (possibly large) matrix \(M\); and \(S\) is in fact also a full matrix because even though \(M\) is sparse, its inverse \(M^{-1}\) will generally be a dense matrix. On the other hand, the CG algorithm doesn't require us to actually have a representation of \(S\): It is sufficient to form matrix-vector products with it. We can do so in steps, using the fact that matrix products are associative (i.e., we can set parentheses in such a way that the product is more convenient to compute): To compute \(Sv=(B^TM^{-1}B)v=B^T(M^{-1}(Bv))\), we </p><ol>
<li>
compute \(w = B v\); </li>
<li>
solve \(My = w\) for \(y=M^{-1}w\), using the CG method applied to the positive definite and symmetric mass matrix \(M\); </li>
<li>
compute \(z=B^Ty\) to obtain \(z=Sv\). </li>
</ol>
<p>Note how we evaluate the expression \(B^TM^{-1}Bv\) right to left to avoid matrix-matrix products; this way, all we have to do is evaluate matrix-vector products.</p>
<p>In the following, we will then have to come up with ways to represent the matrix \(S\) so that it can be used in a Conjugate Gradient solver, as well as to define ways in which we can precondition the solution of the linear system involving \(S\), and deal with solving linear systems with the matrix \(M\) (the second step above).</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The key point in this consideration is to recognize that to implement an iterative solver such as CG or GMRES, we never actually need the actual <em>elements</em> of a matrix! All that is required is that we can form matrix-vector products. The same is true for preconditioners. In deal.II we encode this requirement by only requiring that matrices and preconditioners given to solver classes have a <code>vmult()</code> member function that does the matrix-vector product. How a class chooses to implement this function is not important to the solver. Consequently, classes can implement it by, for example, doing a sequence of products and linear solves as discussed above.</dd></dl>

<p><a class="anchor" id="ApreconditionerfortheSchurcomplement"></a></p><h4>A preconditioner for the Schur complement</h4>
<p>One may ask whether it would help if we had a preconditioner for the Schur complement \(S=B^TM^{-1}B\). The general answer, as usual, is: of course. The problem is only, we don't know anything about this Schur complement matrix. We do not know its entries, all we know is its action. On the other hand, we have to realize that our solver is expensive since in each iteration we have to do one matrix-vector product with the Schur complement, which means that we have to do invert the mass matrix once in each iteration.</p>
<p>There are different approaches to preconditioning such a matrix. On the one extreme is to use something that is cheap to apply and therefore has no real impact on the work done in each iteration. The other extreme is a preconditioner that is itself very expensive, but in return really brings down the number of iterations required to solve with \(S\).</p>
<p>We will try something along the second approach, as much to improve the performance of the program as to demonstrate some techniques. To this end, let us recall that the ideal preconditioner is, of course, \(S^{-1}\), but that is unattainable. However, how about </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} \tilde S^{-1} = [B^T ({\textrm{diag}\ }M)^{-1}B]^{-1} \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> as a preconditioner? That would mean that every time we have to do one preconditioning step, we actually have to solve with \(\tilde S\). At first, this looks almost as expensive as solving with \(S\) right away. However, note that in the inner iteration, we do not have to calculate \(M^{-1}\), but only the inverse of its diagonal, which is cheap.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the <a class="el" href="classLinearOperator.html">LinearOperator</a> framework makes this very easy to write out. We already used a Jacobi preconditioner (<code>preconditioner_M</code>) for the \(M\) matrix earlier. So all that is left to do is to write out how the approximate Schur complement should look like: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="keyword">auto</span> op_aS =</div><div class="line">  <a class="code" href="group__LAOperators.html#ga6bdc65fb2db56230e6bc7d545e81295d">transpose_operator</a>(op_B) * <a class="code" href="group__LAOperators.html#ga6b74b7ed76e4aeea2c67c0bbb03e3e24">linear_operator</a>(preconditioner_M) * op_B;</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> Note how this operator differs in simply doing one Jacobi sweep (i.e. multiplying with the inverses of the diagonal) instead of multiplying with the full \(M^{-1}\). (This is how a single Jacobi preconditioner step with \(M\) is defined: it is the multiplication with the inverse of the diagonal of \(M\); in other words, the operation \(({\textrm{diag}\ }M)^{-1}x\) on a vector \(x\) is exactly what <a class="el" href="classPreconditionJacobi.html">PreconditionJacobi</a> does.)</p>
<p>With all this we almost have the preconditioner completed: it should be the inverse of the approximate Schur complement. We implement this again by creating a linear operator with <a class="el" href="group__LAOperators.html#ga87e38fbde431397c069a88692bd24ae7">inverse_operator()</a> function. This time however we would like to choose a relatively modest tolerance for the CG solver (that inverts <code>op_aS</code>). The reasoning is that <code>op_aS</code> is only coarse approximation to <code>op_S</code>, so we actually do not need to invert it exactly. This, however creates a subtle problem: <code>preconditioner_S</code> will be used in the final outer CG iteration to create an orthogonal basis. But for this to work, it must be precisely the same linear operation for every invocation. We ensure this by using an <a class="el" href="classIterationNumberControl.html">IterationNumberControl</a> that allows us to fix the number of CG iterations that are performed to a fixed small number (in our case 30): </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"><a class="code" href="classIterationNumberControl.html">IterationNumberControl</a> iteration_number_control_aS(30, 1.<a class="code" href="namespacePhysics_1_1Elasticity_1_1Kinematics.html#a9587d5229555daa5b1fa1ba2f8a40adb">e</a>-18);</div><div class="line"><a class="code" href="classSolverCG.html">SolverCG&lt;Vector&lt;double&gt;</a>&gt;           solver_aS(iteration_number_control_aS);</div><div class="line"><a class="code" href="classPreconditionIdentity.html">PreconditionIdentity</a> preconditioner_aS;</div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="keyword">auto</span> preconditioner_S =</div><div class="line">  <a class="code" href="group__LAOperators.html#ga87e38fbde431397c069a88692bd24ae7">inverse_operator</a>(op_aS, solver_aS, preconditioner_aS);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>That's all!</p>
<p>Obviously, applying this inverse of the approximate Schur complement is a very expensive preconditioner, almost as expensive as inverting the Schur complement itself. We can expect it to significantly reduce the number of outer iterations required for the Schur complement. In fact it does: in a typical run on 7 times refined meshes using elements of order 0, the number of outer iterations drops from 592 to 39. On the other hand, we now have to apply a very expensive preconditioner 25 times. A better measure is therefore simply the run-time of the program: on a current laptop (as of January 2019), it drops from 3.57 to 2.05 seconds for this test case. That doesn't seem too impressive, but the savings become more pronounced on finer meshes and with elements of higher order. For example, an seven times refined mesh and using elements of order 2 (which amounts to about 0.4 million degrees of freedom) yields an improvement of 1134 to 83 outer iterations, at a runtime of 168 seconds to 40 seconds. Not earth shattering, but significant.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Definitionofthetestcase"></a></p><h3>Definition of the test case</h3>
<p>In this tutorial program, we will solve the Laplace equation in mixed formulation as stated above. Since we want to monitor convergence of the solution inside the program, we choose right hand side, boundary conditions, and the coefficient so that we recover a solution function known to us. In particular, we choose the pressure solution </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} p = -\left(\frac \alpha 2 xy^2 + \beta x - \frac \alpha 6 x^3\right), \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> and for the coefficient we choose the unit matrix \(K_{ij}=\delta_{ij}\) for simplicity. Consequently, the exact velocity satisfies </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} {\mathbf u} = \left(\begin{array}{cc} \frac \alpha 2 y^2 + \beta - \frac \alpha 2 x^2 \\ \alpha xy \end{array}\right). \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> This solution was chosen since it is exactly divergence free, making it a realistic test case for incompressible fluid flow. By consequence, the right hand side equals \(f=0\), and as boundary values we have to choose \(g=p|_{\partial\Omega}\).</p>
<p>For the computations in this program, we choose \(\alpha=0.3,\beta=1\). You can find the resulting solution in the <a class="anchor" id="#Results"></a>results section below, after the commented program.</p>

Note that these functions have one, one, and <code>dim+1</code> components, respectively, and that we pass the number of components down to the <code><a class="el" href="classFunction.html">Function</a>&lt;dim&gt;</code> base class. For the exact solution, we only declare the function that actually returns the entire solution vector (i.e. all components of it) at once. Here are the respective declarations:</p>

<p>In addition to the other equation data, we also want to use a permeability tensor, or better &ndash; because this is all that appears in the weak form &ndash; the inverse of the permeability tensor, <code>KInverse</code>. For the purpose of verifying the exactness of the solution and determining convergence orders, this tensor is more in the way than helpful. We will therefore simply set it to the identity matrix.</p>
<p>However, a spatially varying permeability tensor is indispensable in real-life porous media flow simulations, and we would like to use the opportunity to demonstrate the technique to use tensor valued functions.</p>
<p>Possibly unsurprisingly, deal.II also has a base class not only for scalar and generally vector-valued functions (the <code><a class="el" href="classFunction.html">Function</a></code> base class) but also for functions that return tensors of fixed dimension and rank, the <code><a class="el" href="classTensorFunction.html">TensorFunction</a></code> template. Here, the function under consideration returns a dim-by-dim matrix, i.e. a tensor of rank 2 and dimension <code>dim</code>. We then choose the template arguments of the base class appropriately.</p>
<p>The interface that the <code><a class="el" href="classTensorFunction.html">TensorFunction</a></code> class provides is essentially equivalent to the <code><a class="el" href="classFunction.html">Function</a></code> class. In particular, there exists a <code>value_list</code> function that takes a list of points at which to evaluate the function, and returns the values of the function in the second argument, a list of tensors:</p>

As in previous examples, we add a check to the beginning of the class to make sure that the sizes of input and output parameters are the same (see <a class="el" href="step_5.html">step-5</a> for a discussion of this technique). Then we loop over all evaluation points, and for each one set the output tensor to the identity matrix.</p>
<p>There is an oddity at the top of the function (the <code>(void)points;</code> statement) that is worth discussing. The values we put into the output <code>values</code> array does not actually depend on the <code>points</code> arrays of coordinates at which the function is evaluated. In other words, the <code>points</code> argument is in fact unused, and we could have just not given it a name if we had wanted. But we want to use the <code>points</code> object for checking that the <code>values</code> object has the correct size. The problem is that in release mode, <code>AssertDimension</code> is defined as a macro that expands to nothing; the compiler will then complain that the <code>points</code> object is unused. The idiomatic approach to silencing this warning is to have a statement that evaluates (reads) variable but doesn't actually do anything: That's what <code>(void)points;</code> does: It reads from <code>points</code>, and then casts the result of the read to <code>void</code>, i.e., nothing. This statement is, in other words, completely pointless and implies no actual action except to explain to the compiler that yes, this variable is in fact used even in release mode. (In debug mode, the <code>AssertDimension</code> macro expands to something that reads from the variable, and so the funny statement would not be necessary in debug mode.)</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="MixedLaplaceProblemMixedLaplaceProblem"></a> </p><h4>MixedLaplaceProblem::MixedLaplaceProblem</h4>
<p>In the constructor of this class, we first store the value that was passed in concerning the degree of the finite elements we shall use (a degree of zero, for example, means to use RT(0) and DG(0)), and then construct the vector valued element belonging to the space \(X_h\) described in the introduction. The rest of the constructor is as in the early tutorial programs.</p>
<p>The only thing worth describing here is the constructor call of the <code>fe</code> variable. The <code><a class="el" href="classFESystem.html">FESystem</a></code> class to which this variable belongs has a number of different constructors that all refer to binding simpler elements together into one larger element. In the present case, we want to couple a single RT(degree) element with a single DQ(degree) element. The constructor to <code><a class="el" href="classFESystem.html">FESystem</a></code> that does this requires us to specify first the first base element (the <code><a class="el" href="classFE__RaviartThomas.html">FE_RaviartThomas</a></code> object of given degree) and then the number of copies for this base element, and then similarly the kind and number of <code><a class="el" href="classFE__DGQ.html">FE_DGQ</a></code> elements. Note that the Raviart-Thomas element already has <code>dim</code> vector components, so that the coupled element will have <code>dim+1</code> vector components, the first <code>dim</code> of which correspond to the velocity variable whereas the last one corresponds to the pressure.</p>
<p>It is also worth comparing the way we constructed this element from its base elements, with the way we have done so in <a class="el" href="step_8.html">step-8</a>: there, we have built it as <code>fe (<a class="el" href="classFE__Q.html">FE_Q</a>&lt;dim&gt;(1), dim)</code>, i.e. we have simply used <code>dim</code> copies of the <code><a class="el" href="classFE__Q.html">FE_Q(1)</a></code> element, one copy for the displacement in each coordinate direction.</p>

As mentioned in the introduction, we want to subdivide the matrix into blocks corresponding to the two different kinds of variables, velocity and pressure. To this end, we first have to make sure that the indices corresponding to velocities and pressures are not intermingled: First all velocity degrees of freedom, then all pressure DoFs. This way, the global matrix separates nicely into a \(2 \times 2\) system. To achieve this, we have to renumber degrees of freedom based on their vector component, an operation that conveniently is already implemented:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><a class="code" href="namespaceDoFRenumbering.html#a52c1941406d1ce2937e29a46edf111f4">DoFRenumbering::component_wise</a>(dof_handler);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>The next thing is that we want to figure out the sizes of these blocks so that we can allocate an appropriate amount of space. To this end, we call the <a class="el" href="namespaceDoFTools.html#a956ac5c6aab03ec1c04f1ad955301db9">DoFTools::count_dofs_per_fe_component()</a> function that counts how many shape functions are non-zero for a particular vector component. We have <code>dim+1</code> vector components, and <a class="el" href="namespaceDoFTools.html#a956ac5c6aab03ec1c04f1ad955301db9">DoFTools::count_dofs_per_fe_component()</a> will count how many shape functions belong to each of these components.</p>
<p>There is one problem here. As described in the documentation of that function, it <em>wants</em> to put the number of \(x\)-velocity shape functions into <code>dofs_per_component[0]</code>, the number of \(y\)-velocity shape functions into <code>dofs_per_component[1]</code> (and similar in 3d), and the number of pressure shape functions into <code>dofs_per_component[dim]</code>. But, the Raviart-Thomas element is special in that it is non-<a class="el" href="DEALGlossary.html#GlossPrimitive">primitive</a>, i.e., for Raviart-Thomas elements all velocity shape functions are nonzero in all components. In other words, the function cannot distinguish between \(x\) and \(y\) velocity functions because there <em>is</em> no such distinction. It therefore puts the overall number of velocity into each of <code>dofs_per_component[c]</code>, \(0\le c\le \text{dim}\). On the other hand, the number of pressure variables equals the number of shape functions that are nonzero in the dim-th component.</p>
<p>Using this knowledge, we can get the number of velocity shape functions from any of the first <code>dim</code> elements of <code>dofs_per_component</code>, and then use this below to initialize the vector and matrix block sizes, as well as create output.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="MixedLaplacecompute_errors"></a> </p><h4>MixedLaplace::compute_errors</h4>
<p>After we have dealt with the linear solver and preconditioners, we continue with the implementation of our main class. In particular, the next task is to compute the errors in our numerical solution, in both the pressures as well as velocities.</p>
<p>To compute errors in the solution, we have already introduced the <code><a class="el" href="namespaceVectorTools.html#a676190d2c897ac5da68a9c460fa95832">VectorTools::integrate_difference</a></code> function in <a class="el" href="step_7.html">step-7</a> and <a class="el" href="step_11.html">step-11</a>. However, there we only dealt with scalar solutions, whereas here we have a vector-valued solution with components that even denote different quantities and may have different orders of convergence (this isn't the case here, by choice of the used finite elements, but is frequently the case in mixed finite element applications). What we therefore have to do is to `mask' the components that we are interested in. This is easily done: the <code><a class="el" href="namespaceVectorTools.html#a676190d2c897ac5da68a9c460fa95832">VectorTools::integrate_difference</a></code> function takes as one of its arguments a pointer to a weight function (the parameter defaults to the null pointer, meaning unit weights). What we have to do is to pass a function object that equals one in the components we are interested in, and zero in the other ones. For example, to compute the pressure error, we should pass a function that represents the constant vector with a unit value in component <code>dim</code>, whereas for the velocity the constant vector should be one in the first <code>dim</code> components, and zero in the location of the pressure.</p>
<p>In deal.II, the <code><a class="el" href="classComponentSelectFunction.html">ComponentSelectFunction</a></code> does exactly this: it wants to know how many vector components the function it is to represent should have (in our case this would be <code>dim+1</code>, for the joint velocity-pressure space) and which individual or range of components should be equal to one. We therefore define two such masks at the beginning of the function, following by an object representing the exact solution and a vector in which we will store the cellwise errors as computed by <code>integrate_difference</code>:</p>

All we can do is approximate this integral using quadrature. This actually presents a slight twist here: if we naively chose an object of type <code><a class="el" href="classQGauss.html">QGauss</a>&lt;dim&gt;(degree+1)</code> as one may be inclined to do (this is what we used for integrating the linear system), one realizes that the error is very small and does not follow the expected convergence curves at all. What is happening is that for the mixed finite elements used here, the Gauss points happen to be superconvergence points in which the pointwise error is much smaller (and converges with higher order) than anywhere else. These are therefore not particularly good points for integration. To avoid this problem, we simply use a trapezoidal rule and iterate it <code>degree+2</code> times in each coordinate direction (again as explained in <a class="el" href="step_7.html">step-7</a>):</p>

</pre><p>The fact that the number of iterations is so small, of course, is due to the good (but expensive!) preconditioner we have developed. To get confidence in the solution, let us take a look at it. The following three images show (from left to right) the x-velocity, the y-velocity, and the pressure:</p>
<table style="width:60%" align="center">
<tr>

</div>
  </td></tr>
</table>
<p>Let us start with the pressure: it is highest at the left and lowest at the right, so flow will be from left to right. In addition, though hardly visible in the graph, we have chosen the pressure field such that the flow left-right flow first channels towards the center and then outward again. Consequently, the x-velocity has to increase to get the flow through the narrow part, something that can easily be seen in the left image. The middle image represents inward flow in y-direction at the left end of the domain, and outward flow in y-direction at the right end of the domain.</p>
<p>As an additional remark, note how the x-velocity in the left image is only continuous in x-direction, whereas the y-velocity is continuous in y-direction. The flow fields are discontinuous in the other directions. This very obviously reflects the continuity properties of the Raviart-Thomas elements, which are, in fact, only in the space H(div) and not in the space \(H^1\). Finally, the pressure field is completely discontinuous, but that should not surprise given that we have chosen <code><a class="el" href="classFE__DGQ.html">FE_DGQ(0)</a></code> as the finite element for that solution component.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Convergence"></a></p><h3>Convergence</h3>
<p>The program offers two obvious places where playing and observing convergence is in order: the degree of the finite elements used (passed to the constructor of the <code>MixedLaplaceProblem</code> class from <code>main()</code>), and the refinement level (determined in <code>MixedLaplaceProblem::make_grid_and_dofs</code>). What one can do is to change these values and observe the errors computed later on in the course of the program run.</p>
<p>If one does this, one finds the following pattern for the \(L_2\) error in the pressure variable: </p><table align="center" class="doxtable">

<p><a class="anchor" id="Morerealisticpermeabilityfields"></a></p><h4>More realistic permeability fields</h4>
<p>Realistic flow computations for ground water or oil reservoir simulations will not use a constant permeability. Here's a first, rather simple way to change this situation: we use a permeability that decays very rapidly away from a central flowline until it hits a background value of 0.001. This is to mimic the behavior of fluids in sandstone: in most of the domain, the sandstone is homogeneous and, while permeable to fluids, not overly so; on the other stone, the stone has cracked, or faulted, along one line, and the fluids flow much easier along this large crack. Here is how we could implement something like this: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">template</span> &lt;<span class="keywordtype">int</span> dim&gt;</div><div class="line"><span class="keywordtype">void</span></div><div class="line">KInverse&lt;dim&gt;::value_list (<span class="keyword">const</span> std::vector&lt;<a class="code" href="classPoint.html">Point&lt;dim&gt;</a> &gt; &amp;points,</div><div class="line">                           std::vector&lt;<a class="code" href="classTensor.html">Tensor&lt;2,dim&gt;</a> &gt;    &amp;values)<span class="keyword"> const</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword"></span>{</div><div class="line">  <a class="code" href="group__Exceptions.html#ga70a0bb353656e704acf927945277bbc6">Assert</a> (points.size() == values.<a class="code" href="classVector.html#a81dcfa5c77bdd426603386c0844149ae">size</a>(),</div><div class="line">          <a class="code" href="group__Exceptions.html#ga6060b2304b8600f5efa0d31eeda0207d">ExcDimensionMismatch</a> (points.size(), values.<a class="code" href="classVector.html#a81dcfa5c77bdd426603386c0844149ae">size</a>()));</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">  <span class="keywordflow">for</span> (<span class="keywordtype">unsigned</span> <span class="keywordtype">int</span> p=0; p&lt;points.size(); ++p)</div><div class="line">    {</div><div class="line">      values[p].clear ();</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">      <span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="keywordtype">double</span> distance_to_flowline</div><div class="line">        = <a class="code" href="namespaceDifferentiation_1_1SD.html#a592560ee80355620422a86087f11b9df">std::fabs</a>(points[p][1]-0.2*std::sin(10*points[p][0]));</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">      <span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="keywordtype">double</span> permeability = <a class="code" href="namespaceVectorTools_1_1EvaluationFlags.html#ac6721740e24732d6afabcf28ddfc1ffda8e7f5b8545162dccd5ed717792bdf420">std::max</a>(std::exp(-(distance_to_flowline*</div><div class="line">                                                      distance_to_flowline)</div><div class="line">                                                    / (0.1 * 0.1)),</div><div class="line">                                           0.001);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">      <span class="keywordflow">for</span> (<span class="keywordtype">unsigned</span> <span class="keywordtype">int</span> <a class="code" href="namespacePhysics_1_1Elasticity_1_1Kinematics.html#a15728437b942dab0b0042eb06a407d2c">d</a>=0; <a class="code" href="namespacePhysics_1_1Elasticity_1_1Kinematics.html#a15728437b942dab0b0042eb06a407d2c">d</a>&lt;dim; ++<a class="code" href="namespacePhysics_1_1Elasticity_1_1Kinematics.html#a15728437b942dab0b0042eb06a407d2c">d</a>)</div><div class="line">        values[p][<a class="code" href="namespacePhysics_1_1Elasticity_1_1Kinematics.html#a15728437b942dab0b0042eb06a407d2c">d</a>][<a class="code" href="namespacePhysics_1_1Elasticity_1_1Kinematics.html#a15728437b942dab0b0042eb06a407d2c">d</a>] = 1./permeability;</div><div class="line">    }</div><div class="line">}</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> Remember that the function returns the inverse of the permeability tensor.</p>

<p>It is obvious how fluids flow essentially only along the middle line, and not anywhere else.</p>
<p>Another possibility would be to use a random permeability field. A simple way to achieve this would be to scatter a number of centers around the domain and then use a permeability field that is the sum of (negative) exponentials for each of these centers. Flow would then try to hop from one center of high permeability to the next one. This is an entirely unscientific attempt at describing a random medium, but one possibility to implement this behavior would look like this: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">template</span> &lt;<span class="keywordtype">int</span> dim&gt;</div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">class </span>KInverse : <span class="keyword">public</span> <a class="code" href="classTensorFunction.html">TensorFunction</a>&lt;2,dim&gt;</div><div class="line">{</div><div class="line">  <span class="keyword">public</span>:</div><div class="line">    KInverse ();</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    <span class="keyword">virtual</span> <span class="keywordtype">void</span> <a class="code" href="classTensorFunction.html#a3afbbe3ba38a517e8a97db9adf2cb340">value_list</a> (<span class="keyword">const</span> std::vector&lt;<a class="code" href="classPoint.html">Point&lt;dim&gt;</a> &gt;

<p>As mentioned in the introduction, the Schur complement solver used here is not the best one conceivable (nor is it intended to be a particularly good one). Better ones can be found in the literature and can be built using the same block matrix techniques that were introduced here. We pick up on this theme again in <a class="el" href="step_22.html">step-22</a>, where we first build a Schur complement solver for the Stokes equation as we did here, and then in the <a href="step_22.html#improved-solver">Improved Solvers</a> section discuss better ways based on solving the system as a whole but preconditioning based on individual blocks. We will also come back to this in <a class="el" href="step_43.html">step-43</a>.</p>

(All video lectures are also available &lt;a href="http://www.math.colostate.edu/~bangerth/videos.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)  
</pre><p> This program is devoted to two aspects: the use of mixed finite elements</p>
<ul>
<li>inparticular Raviart-Thomas elements</li>
<li>and using block matrices to definesolvers, preconditioners, and nested versions of those that use thesubstructure of the system matrix. The equation we are going to solve is againthe Poisson equation, though with a matrix-valued coefficient: <p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} -\nabla \cdot K({\mathbf x}) \nabla p &amp;=&amp; f \qquad {\textrm{in}\ } \Omega, \\ p &amp;=&amp; g \qquad {\textrm{on}\ }\partial\Omega. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
 \(K({\mathbf x})\) is assumed to be uniformly positive definite, i.e., there is \(\alpha&gt;0\) such that the eigenvalues \(\lambda_i({\mathbf x})\) of \(K(x)\) satisfy \(\lambda_i({\mathbf x})\ge \alpha\) . The use of the symbol \(p\) instead of the usual \(u\) for the solution variable will become clear in the next section. After discussing the equation and the formulation we are going to use to solveit, this introduction will cover the use of block matrices and vectors, thedefinition of solvers and preconditioners, and finally the actual test case weare going to solve. We are going to extend this tutorial program in <a class="el" href="step_21.html">step-21</a> tosolve not only the mixed Laplace equation, but add another equation thatdescribes the transport of a mixture of two fluids. The equations covered here fall into the class of vector-valued problems. Atoplevel overview of this topic can be found in the <a class="el" href="group__vector__valued.html">Handling vector valued problems</a> module.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Theequations"></a></p><h3>The equations</h3>
<p>In the form above, the Poisson equation (i.e., the Laplace equation with a nonzeroright hand side) is generally considered a good model equationfor fluid flow in porous media. Of course, one typically models fluid flow throughthe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations">Navier-Stokes equations</a> or, if fluid velocities are slow or the viscosity is large, the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes_flow">Stokes equations</a>(which we cover in <a class="el" href="step_22.html">step-22</a> ).In the first of these two models, the forces that act are inertia andviscous friction, whereas in the second it is only viscous friction</p>
<ul>
<li>i.e.,forces that one fluid particle exerts on a nearby one. This is appropriateif you have free flow in a large domain, say a pipe, a river, or in the air.On the other hand, if the fluid is confined in pores, then friction forcesexerted by the pore walls on the fluid become more and more important andinternal viscous friction becomes less and less important. Modeling thisthen first leads to the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy%27s_law#Brinkman_form_of_Darcy&apos;s_law">Brinkman model</a> if both effects are important, and in the limit of very small poresto the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy%27s_law">Darcy equations</a>.The latter is just a different name for the Poisson or Laplace equation,connotating it with the area to which one wants to apply it: slow flowin a porous medium. In essence it says that the velocity is proportionalto the negative pressure gradient that drives the fluid through theporous medium. The Darcy equation models this pressure that drives the flow. (Because thesolution variable is a pressure, we here use the name \(p\) instead of thename \(u\) more commonly used for the solution of partial differential equations.)Typical applications of this view of the Laplace equation are then modelinggroundwater flow, or the flow of hydrocarbons in oil reservoirs. In theseapplications, \(K\) is the permeability tensor, i.e., a measure for how muchresistance the soil or rock matrix asserts on the fluid flow. In the applications named above, a desirable feature for a numericalscheme is that it should be locally conservative, i.e., that whateverflows into a cell also flows out of it (or the difference is equal tothe integral over the source terms over each cell, if the sources arenonzero). However, as it turns out, the usual discretizations of theLaplace equation (such as those used in <a class="el" href="step_3.html">step-3</a> , <a class="el" href="step_4.html">step-4</a> , or <a class="el" href="step_6.html">step-6</a> ) donot satisfy this property. But, one can achieve this by choosing adifferent formulation of the problem and a particular combination offinite element spaces.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Formulationweakformanddiscreteproblem"></a></p><h3>Formulation, weak form, and discrete problem</h3>
<p>To this end, one first introduces a second variable, called the velocity, \({\mathbf u}=-K\nabla p\) . By its definition, the velocity is a vector in thenegativedirection of the pressure gradient, multiplied by the permeability tensor. Ifthe permeability tensor is proportional to the unit matrix, this equation iseasy to understand and intuitive: the higher the permeability, the higher thevelocity; and the velocity is proportional to the gradient of the pressure, going fromareas of high pressure to areas of low pressure (thus the negative sign). With this second variable, one then finds an alternative version of theLaplace equation, called the <em>mixed formulation</em>: </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} K^{-1} {\mathbf u} + \nabla p &amp;=&amp; 0 \qquad {\textrm{in}\ } \Omega, \\ -{\textrm{div}}\ {\mathbf u} &amp;=&amp; -f \qquad {\textrm{in}\ }\Omega, \\ p &amp;=&amp; g \qquad {\textrm{on}\ } \partial\Omega. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> Here, we have multiplied the equation defining the velocity \({\mathbf u}\) by \(K^{-1}\) because this makes the set of equations symmetric: oneof the equations has the gradient, the second the negative divergence,and these two are of course adjoints of each other, resulting in asymmetric bilinear form and a consequently symmetric system matrixunder the common assumption that \(K\) is a symmetric tensor. The weak formulation of this problem is found by multiplying the twoequations with test functions and integrating some terms by parts: </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} A(\{{\mathbf u},p\},\{{\mathbf v},q\}) = F(\{{\mathbf v},q\}), \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> where </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} A(\{{\mathbf u},p\},\{{\mathbf v},q\}) &amp;=&amp; ({\mathbf v}, K^{-1}{\mathbf u})_\Omega - ({\textrm{div}}\ {\mathbf v}, p)_\Omega - (q,{\textrm{div}}\ {\mathbf u})_\Omega \\ F(\{{\mathbf v},q\}) &amp;=&amp; -(g,{\mathbf v}\cdot {\mathbf n})_{\partial\Omega} - (f,q)_\Omega. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> Here, \({\mathbf n}\) is the outward normal vector at the boundary. Note how in thisformulation, Dirichlet boundary values of the original problem areincorporated in the weak form. To be well-posed, we have to look for solutions and test functions in thespace \(H({\textrm{div}})=\{{\mathbf w}\in L^2(\Omega)^d:\ {\textrm{div}}\ {\mathbf w}\in L^2\}\) for \(\mathbf u\) , \(\mathbf v\) , and \(L^2\) for \(p,q\) . It is a well-known fact stated inalmost every book on finite element theory that if one chooses discrete finiteelement spaces for the approximation of \({\mathbf u},p\) inappropriately, then theresulting discrete problem is instable and the discrete solutionwill not converge to the exact solution. (Some details on the problemconsidered here</p>
<ul>
<li>which falls in the class of "saddle-point problems"</li>
<li>can be found on the Wikipedia page on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladyzhenskaya%E2%80%93Babu%C5%A1ka%E2%80%93Brezzi_condition">Ladyzhenskaya-Babuska-Brezzi (LBB) condition</a>.) To overcome this, a number of different finite element pairs for \({\mathbf u},p\) have been developed that lead to a stable discrete problem. One such pair isto use the Raviart-Thomas spaces \(RT(k)\) for the velocity \({\mathbf u}\) anddiscontinuous elements of class \(DQ(k)\) for the pressure \(p\) . For detailsabout these spaces, we refer in particular to the book on mixed finite elementmethods by Brezzi and Fortin, but many other books on the theory of finiteelements, for example the classic book by Brenner and Scott, also state therelevant results. In any case, with appropriate choices of functionspaces, the discrete formulation reads as follows: Find \({\mathbf u}_h,p_h\) so that <p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} A(\{{\mathbf u}_h,p_h\},\{{\mathbf v}_h,q_h\}) = F(\{{\mathbf v}_h,q_h\}) \qquad\qquad \forall {\mathbf v}_h,q_h. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Before continuing, let us briefly pause and show that the choice offunction spaces above provides us with the desired local conservationproperty. In particular, because the pressure space consists ofdiscontinuous piecewise polynomials, we can choose the test function \(q\) as the function that is equal to one on any given cell \(K\) andzero everywhere else. If we also choose \({\mathbf v}=0\) everywhere(remember that the weak form above has to hold for <em>all</em> discretetest functions \(q,v\) ), then putting these choices of test functionsinto the weak formulation above implies in particular that </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} - (1,{\textrm{div}}\ {\mathbf u}_h)_K = -(1,f)_K, \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> which we can of course write in more explicit form as </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} \int_K {\textrm{div}}\ {\mathbf u}_h = \int_K f. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> Applying the divergence theorem results in the fact that \({\mathbf u}_h\) has to satisfy, for every choice of cell \(K\) , the relationship </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} \int_{\partial K} {\mathbf u}_h\cdot{\mathbf n} = \int_K f. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> If you now recall that \({\mathbf u}\) was the velocity, then theintegral on the left is exactly the (discrete) flux across theboundary of the cell \(K\) . The statement is then that the flux must be equalto the integral over the sources within \(K\) . In particular, if thereare no sources (i.e., \(f=0\) in \(K\) ), then the statement is that<em>total</em> flux is zero, i.e., whatever flows into a cell must flow outof it through some other part of the cell boundary. This is what we call<em>local conservation</em> because it holds for every cell. On the other hand, the usual continuous \(Q_k\) elements would not result inthis kind of property when used for the pressure (as, for example, wedo in <a class="el" href="step_43.html">step-43</a> ) because one can not choose a discrete test function \(q_h\) that is one on a cell \(K\) and zero everywhere else: It would bediscontinuous and consequently not in the finite elementspace. (Strictly speaking, all we can say is that the proof abovewould not work for continuous elements. Whether these elements mightstill result in local conservation is a different question as onecould think that a different kind of proof might still work; inreality, however, the property really does not hold.)</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Assemblingthelinearsystem"></a></p><h3>Assembling the linear system</h3>
<p>The deal.II library (of course) implements Raviart-Thomas elements \(RT(k)\) ofarbitrary order \(k\) , as well as discontinuous elements \(DG(k)\) . If we forgetabout their particular properties for a second, we then have to solve adiscrete problem </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} A(x_h,w_h) = F(w_h), \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> with the bilinear form and right hand side as stated above, and \(x_h=\{{\mathbf u}_h,p_h\}\) , \(w_h=\{{\mathbf v}_h,q_h\}\) . Both \(x_h\) and \(w_h\) are from the space \(X_h=RT(k)\times DQ(k)\) , where \(RT(k)\) is itself a space of \(dim\) -dimensionalfunctions to accommodate for the fact that the flow velocity is vector-valued.The necessary question then is: how do we do this in a program? Vector-valued elements have already been discussed in previous tutorialprograms, the first time and in detail in <a class="el" href="step_8.html">step-8</a> . The main difference therewas that the vector-valued space \(V_h\) is uniform in all its components: the \(dim\) components of the displacement vector are all equal and from the samefunction space. What we could therefore do was to build \(V_h\) as the outerproduct of the \(dim\) times the usual \(Q(1)\) finite element space, and by thismake sure that all our shape functions have only a single non-zero vectorcomponent. Instead of dealing with vector-valued shape functions, all we didin <a class="el" href="step_8.html">step-8</a> was therefore to look at the (scalar) only non-zero component anduse the <code>fe.system_to_component_index(i).first</code> call to figure outwhich component this actually is. This doesn't work with Raviart-Thomas elements: following from theirconstruction to satisfy certain regularity properties of the space \(H({\textrm{div}})\) , the shape functions of \(RT(k)\) are usually nonzero in alltheir vector components at once. For this reason, were <code>fe.system_to_component_index(i).first</code> applied to determine the onlynonzero component of shape function \(i\) , an exception would be generated. Whatwe really need to do is to get at <em> all </em> vector components of a shapefunction. In deal.II diction, we call such finite elements <em> non-primitive </em> , whereas finite elements that are either scalar or forwhich every vector-valued shape function is nonzero only in a single vectorcomponent are called <em> primitive </em> . So what do we have to do for non-primitive elements? To figure this out, letus go back in the tutorial programs, almost to the very beginnings. There, welearned that we use the <code><a class="el" href="classFEValues.html">FEValues</a></code> class to determine the values andgradients of shape functions at quadrature points. For example, we would call <code>fe_values.shape_value(i,q_point)</code> to obtain the value of the <code>i</code> th shape function on the quadrature point with number <code>q_point</code> . Later, in <a class="el" href="step_8.html">step-8</a> and other tutorial programs, we learnedthat this function call also works for vector-valued shape functions (ofprimitive finite elements), and that it returned the value of the onlynon-zero component of shape function <code>i</code> at quadrature point <code>q_point</code> . For non-primitive shape functions, this is clearly not going to work: there isno single non-zero vector component of shape function <code>i</code> , and the callto <code>fe_values.shape_value(i,q_point)</code> would consequently not makemuch sense. However, deal.II offers a second function call, <code>fe_values.shape_value_component(i,q_point,comp)</code> that returns thevalue of the <code>comp</code>th vector component of shape function <code>i</code> atquadrature point <code>q_point</code>, where <code>comp</code> is an index betweenzero and the number of vector components of the present finite element; forexample, the element we will use to describe velocities and pressures is goingto have \(dim+1\) components. It is worth noting that this function call canalso be used for primitive shape functions: it will simply return zero for allcomponents except one; for non-primitive shape functions, it will in generalreturn a non-zero value for more than just one component. We could now attempt to rewrite the bilinear form above in terms of vectorcomponents. For example, in 2d, the first term could be rewritten like this(note that \(u_0=x_0, u_1=x_1, p=x_2\) ): </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} ({\mathbf u}_h^i, K^{-1}{\mathbf u}_h^j) = &amp;\left((x_h^i)_0, K^{-1}_{00} (x_h^j)_0\right) + \left((x_h^i)_0, K^{-1}_{01} (x_h^j)_1\right) + \\ &amp;\left((x_h^i)_1, K^{-1}_{10} (x_h^j)_0\right) + \left((x_h^i)_1, K^{-1}_{11} (x_h^j)_1\right). \end{eqnarray*}
</p>

boundary contributions). What this piece of code does is, given an <code>fe_values</code> object, to extractthe values of the first \(dim\) components of shape function <code>i</code> atquadrature points <code>q</code> , that is the velocity components of that shapefunction. Put differently, if we write shape functions \(x_h^i\) as the tuple \(\{{\mathbf u}_h^i,p_h^i\}\) , then the function returns the velocity part of thistuple. Note that the velocity is of course a <code>dim</code> -dimensional tensor, andthat the function returns a corresponding object. Similarly, where wesubscript with the pressure extractor, we extract the scalar pressurecomponent. The whole mechanism is described in more detail in the <a class="el" href="group__vector__valued.html">Handling vector valued problems</a> module. In practice, it turns out that we can do a bit better if we evaluate the shapefunctions, their gradients and divergences only once per outermost loop, andstore the result, as this saves us a few otherwise repeated computations (it ispossible to save even more repeated operations by calculating all relevantquantities in advance and then only inserting the results in the actual loop,see <a class="el" href="step_22.html">step-22</a> for a realization of that approach).The final result then looks like this, working in every space dimension: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">

<p><a class="anchor" id="Linearsolversandpreconditioners"></a></p><h3>Linear solvers and preconditioners</h3>
<p>After assembling the linear system we are faced with the task of solvingit. The problem here is that the matrix possesses two undesirable properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness_of_a_matrix">indefinite</a>, i.e., it has both positive and negative eigenvalues. We don't want to prove this property here, but note that this is true for all matrices of the form \(\left(\begin{array}{cc} M &amp; B \\ B^T &amp; 0 \end{array}\right)\) such as the one here where \(M\) is positive definite.</li>
<li>The matrix has a zero block at the bottom right (there is no term in the bilinear form that couples the pressure \(p\) with the pressure test function \(q\) ). At least it is symmetric, but the first issue above still means thatthe Conjugate Gradient method is not going to work since it is onlyapplicable to problems in which the matrix is symmetric and positive definite.We would have to resort to other iterative solvers instead, such asMinRes, SymmLQ, or GMRES, that can deal with indefinite systems. However, thenthe next problem immediately surfaces: Due to the zero block, there are zeroson the diagonal and none of the usual, "simple" preconditioners (Jacobi, SSOR)will work as they require division by diagonal elements. For the matrix sizes we expect to run with this program, the by far simplestapproach would be to just use a direct solver (in particular, theSparseDirectUMFPACK class that is bundled with deal.II). <a class="el" href="step_29.html">step-29</a> goes thisroute and shows that solving <em>any</em> linear system can be done in just3 or 4 lines of code. But then, this is a tutorial: We teach how to do things. Consequently,in the following, we will introduce some techniques that can be used in caseslike these. Namely, we will consider the linear system as not consisting of onelarge matrix and vectors, but we will want to decompose matricesinto <em>blocks</em> that correspond to the individual operators that appear inthe system. We note that the resulting solver is not optimal</li>
<li>there aremuch better ways to efficiently compute the system, for example thoseexplained in the results section of <a class="el" href="step_22.html">step-22</a> or the one we use in <a class="el" href="step_43.html">step-43</a> for a problem similar to the current one. Here, our goal is simply tointroduce new solution techniques and how they can be implemented indeal.II.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="anchor" id="SolvingusingtheSchurcomplement"></a></p><h4>Solving using the Schur complement</h4>
<p>In view of the difficulties using standard solvers and preconditionersmentioned above, let us take another look at the matrix. If we sort ourdegrees of freedom so that all velocity come before all pressure variables,then we can subdivide the linear system \(Ax=b\) into the following blocks: </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} \left(\begin{array}{cc} M &amp; B \\ B^T &amp; 0 \end{array}\right) \left(\begin{array}{cc} U \\ P \end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{cc} F \\ G \end{array}\right), \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> where \(U,P\) are the values of velocity and pressure degrees of freedom,respectively, \(M\) is the mass matrix on the velocity space, \(B^T\) corresponds tothe negative divergence operator, and \(B\) is its transpose and correspondsto the gradient. By block elimination, we can then re-order this system in the following way(multiply the first row of the system by \(B^TM^{-1}\) and then subtract thesecond row from it): </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} B^TM^{-1}B P &amp;=&amp; B^TM^{-1} F - G, \\ MU &amp;=&amp; F - BP. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> Here, the matrix \(S=B^TM^{-1}B\) (called the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schur_complement">Schur complement</a>of \(A\) )is obviously symmetric and, owing to the positive definiteness of \(M\) and thefact that \(B\) has full column rank, \(S\) is also positivedefinite. Consequently, if we could compute \(S\) , we could apply the Conjugate Gradientmethod to it. However, computing \(S\) is expensive because it requires usto compute the inverse of the (possibly large) matrix \(M\) ; and \(S\) is in factalso a full matrix because even though \(M\) is sparse, its inverse \(M^{-1}\) will generally be a dense matrix.On the other hand, the CG algorithm doesn't requireus to actually have a representation of \(S\) : It is sufficient to formmatrix-vector products with it. We can do so in steps, using the fact thatmatrix products are associative (i.e., we can set parentheses in such away that the product is more convenient to compute):To compute \(Sv=(B^TM^{-1}B)v=B^T(M^{-1}(Bv))\) , we </p><ol>
<li>
compute \(w = B v\) ; </li>
<li>
solve \(My = w\) for \(y=M^{-1}w\) , using the CG method applied to the positive definite and symmetric mass matrix \(M\) ; </li>
<li>
compute \(z=B^Ty\) to obtain \(z=Sv\) . </li>
</ol>
<p>Note how we evaluate the expression \(B^TM^{-1}Bv\) right to left toavoid matrix-matrix products; this way, all we have to do is evaluatematrix-vector products. In the following, we will then have to come up with ways to represent thematrix \(S\) so that it can be used in a Conjugate Gradient solver,as well as to define ways in which we can precondition the solutionof the linear system involving \(S\) , and deal with solving linear systemswith the matrix \(M\) (the second step above). </p><dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The key point in this consideration is to recognize that to implementan iterative solver such as CG or GMRES, we never actually need the actual<em>elements</em> of a matrix! All that is required is that we can formmatrix-vector products. The same is true for preconditioners. In deal.II weencode this requirement by only requiring that matrices and preconditionersgiven to solver classes have a <code>vmult()</code> member function thatdoes the matrix-vector product. How a class chooses to implement thisfunction is not important to the solver. Consequently, classes canimplement it by, for example, doing a sequence of products and linearsolves as discussed above.</dd></dl>

<p><a class="anchor" id="ApreconditionerfortheSchurcomplement"></a></p><h4>A preconditioner for the Schur complement</h4>
<p>One may ask whether it would help if we had a preconditioner for the Schurcomplement \(S=B^TM^{-1}B\) . The general answer, as usual, is: of course. Theproblem is only, we don't know anything about this Schur complement matrix. Wedo not know its entries, all we know is its action. On the other hand, we haveto realize that our solver is expensive since in each iteration we have to doone matrix-vector product with the Schur complement, which means that we haveto do invert the mass matrix once in each iteration. There are different approaches to preconditioning such a matrix. On the oneextreme is to use something that is cheap to apply and therefore has no realimpact on the work done in each iteration. The other extreme is apreconditioner that is itself very expensive, but in return really brings downthe number of iterations required to solve with \(S\) . We will try something along the second approach, as much to improve theperformance of the program as to demonstrate some techniques. To this end, letus recall that the ideal preconditioner is, of course, \(S^{-1}\) , but that isunattainable. However, how about </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} \tilde S^{-1} = [B^T ({\textrm{diag}\ }M)^{-1}B]^{-1} \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> as a preconditioner? That would mean that every time we have to do onepreconditioning step, we actually have to solve with \(\tilde S\) . At first,this looks almost as expensive as solving with \(S\) right away. However, notethat in the inner iteration, we do not have to calculate \(M^{-1}\) , but onlythe inverse of its diagonal, which is cheap. Thankfully, the <a class="el" href="classLinearOperator.html">LinearOperator</a> framework makes this very easy to write out.We already used a Jacobi preconditioner ( <code>preconditioner_M</code> ) forthe \(M\) matrix earlier. So all that is left to do is to write out how theapproximate Schur complement should look like: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="keyword">auto</span> op_aS =</div><div class="line">  <a class="code" href="group__LAOperators.html#ga6bdc65fb2db56230e6bc7d545e81295d">transpose_operator</a>(op_B) <a class="code" href="group__LAOperators.html#ga6b74b7ed76e4aeea2c67c0bbb03e3e24">linear_operator</a>(preconditioner_M) op_B;</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> Note how this operator differs in simply doing one Jacobi sweep(i.e. multiplying with the inverses of the diagonal) instead of multiplyingwith the full \(M^{-1}\) . (This is how a single Jacobi preconditioner stepwith \(M\) is defined: it is the multiplication with the inverse of thediagonal of \(M\) ; in other words, the operation \(({\textrm{diag}\ }M)^{-1}x\) on a vector \(x\) is exactly what <a class="el" href="classPreconditionJacobi.html">PreconditionJacobi</a> does.) With all this we almost have the preconditioner completed: it should be theinverse of the approximate Schur complement. We implement this again bycreating a linear operator with <a class="el" href="group__LAOperators.html#ga87e38fbde431397c069a88692bd24ae7">inverse_operator()</a> function. This timehowever we would like to choose a relatively modest tolerance for the CGsolver (that inverts <code>op_aS</code> ). The reasoning is that <code>op_aS</code> is only coarse approximation to <code>op_S</code> , so weactually do not need to invert it exactly. This, however creates a subtleproblem: <code>preconditioner_S</code> will be used in the final outer CGiteration to create an orthogonal basis. But for this to work, it must beprecisely the same linear operation for every invocation. We ensure this byusing an <a class="el" href="classIterationNumberControl.html">IterationNumberControl</a> that allows us to fix the number of CGiterations that are performed to a fixed small number (in our case 30): </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"><a class="code" href="classIterationNumberControl.html">IterationNumberControl</a> iteration_number_control_aS(30, 1.<a class="code" href="namespacePhysics_1_1Elasticity_1_1Kinematics.html#a9587d5229555daa5b1fa1ba2f8a40adb">e</a>-18);</div><div class="line"><a class="code" href="classSolverCG.html">SolverCG&lt;Vector&lt;double&gt;</a>&gt;           solver_aS(iteration_number_control_aS);</div><div class="line"><a class="code" href="classPreconditionIdentity.html">PreconditionIdentity</a> preconditioner_aS;</div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="keyword">auto</span> preconditioner_S =</div><div class="line">  <a class="code" href="group__LAOperators.html#ga87e38fbde431397c069a88692bd24ae7">inverse_operator</a>(op_aS, solver_aS, preconditioner_aS);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>That's all! Obviously, applying this inverse of the approximate Schur complement is a veryexpensive preconditioner, almost as expensive as inverting the Schurcomplement itself. We can expect it to significantly reduce the number ofouter iterations required for the Schur complement. In fact it does: in atypical run on 7 times refined meshes using elements of order 0, the number ofouter iterations drops from 592 to 39. On the other hand, we now have to applya very expensive preconditioner 25 times. A better measure is therefore simplythe run-time of the program: on a current laptop (as of January 2019), itdrops from 3.57 to 2.05 seconds for this test case. That doesn't seem tooimpressive, but the savings become more pronounced on finer meshes and withelements of higher order. For example, an seven times refined mesh andusing elements of order 2 (which amounts to about 0.4 million degrees offreedom) yields an improvement of 1134 to 83 outer iterations, at a runtimeof 168 seconds to 40 seconds. Not earth shattering, but significant.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Definitionofthetestcase"></a></p><h3>Definition of the test case</h3>
<p>In this tutorial program, we will solve the Laplace equation in mixedformulation as stated above. Since we want to monitor convergence of thesolution inside the program, we choose right hand side, boundary conditions,and the coefficient so that we recover a solution function known to us. Inparticular, we choose the pressure solution </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} p = -\left(\frac \alpha 2 xy^2 + \beta x - \frac \alpha 6 x^3\right), \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> and for the coefficient we choose the unit matrix \(K_{ij}=\delta_{ij}\) forsimplicity. Consequently, the exact velocity satisfies </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} {\mathbf u} = \left(\begin{array}{cc} \frac \alpha 2 y^2 + \beta - \frac \alpha 2 x^2 \\ \alpha xy \end{array}\right). \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> This solution was chosen since it is exactly divergence free, making it arealistic test case for incompressible fluid flow. By consequence, the righthand side equals \(f=0\) , and as boundary values we have to choose \(g=p|_{\partial\Omega}\) . For the computations in this program, we choose \(\alpha=0.3,\beta=1\) . You canfind the resulting solution in the <a class="anchor" id="#Results"></a>results section below, after the commented program.</p>

<p>In addition to the other equation data, we also want to use a permeability tensor, or better</p>
<ul>
<li>because this is all that appears in the weak form</li>
<li>the inverse of the permeability tensor, <code>KInverse</code> . For the purpose of verifying the exactness of the solution and determining convergence orders, this tensor is more in the way than helpful. We will therefore simply set it to the identity matrix. However, a spatially varying permeability tensor is indispensable in real-life porous media flow simulations, and we would like to use the opportunity to demonstrate the technique to use tensor valued functions. Possibly unsurprisingly, deal.II also has a base class not only for scalar and generally vector-valued functions (the <code><a class="el" href="classFunction.html">Function</a></code> base class) but also for functions that return tensors of fixed dimension and rank, the <code><a class="el" href="classTensorFunction.html">TensorFunction</a></code> template. Here, the function under consideration returns a dim-by-dim matrix, i.e. a tensor of rank 2 and dimension <code>dim</code> . We then choose the template arguments of the base class appropriately. The interface that the <code><a class="el" href="classTensorFunction.html">TensorFunction</a></code> class provides is essentially equivalent to the <code><a class="el" href="classFunction.html">Function</a></code> class. In particular, there exists a <code>value_list</code> function that takes a list of points at which to evaluate the function, and returns the values of the function in the second argument, a list of tensors:</li>

As in previous examples, we add a check to the beginning of the class to make sure that the sizes of input and output parameters are the same (see <a class="el" href="step_5.html">step-5</a> for a discussion of this technique). Then we loop over all evaluation points, and for each one set the output tensor to the identity matrix. There is an oddity at the top of the function (the <code>(void)points;</code> statement) that is worth discussing. The values we put into the output <code>values</code> array does not actually depend on the <code>points</code> arrays of coordinates at which the function is evaluated. In other words, the <code>points</code> argument is in fact unused, and we could have just not given it a name if we had wanted. But we want to use the <code>points</code> object for checking that the <code>values</code> object has the correct size. The problem is that in release mode, <code>AssertDimension</code> is defined as a macro that expands to nothing; the compiler will then complain that the <code>points</code> object is unused. The idiomatic approach to silencing this warning is to have a statement that evaluates (reads) variable but doesn't actually do anything: That's what <code>(void)points;</code> does: It reads from <code>points</code>, and then casts the result of the read to <code>void</code>, i.e., nothing. This statement is, in other words, completely pointless and implies no actual action except to explain to the compiler that yes, this variable is in fact used even in release mode. (In debug mode, the <code>AssertDimension</code> macro expands to something that reads from the variable, and so the funny statement would not be necessary in debug mode.)</p>

</pre><p>In the constructor of this class, we first store the value that was passed in concerning the degree of the finite elements we shall use (a degree of zero, for example, means to use RT(0) and DG(0)), and then construct the vector valued element belonging to the space \(X_h\) described in the introduction. The rest of the constructor is as in the early tutorial programs. The only thing worth describing here is the constructor call of the <code>fe</code> variable. The <code><a class="el" href="classFESystem.html">FESystem</a></code> class to which this variable belongs has a number of different constructors that all refer to binding simpler elements together into one larger element. In the present case, we want to couple a single RT(degree) element with a single DQ(degree) element. The constructor to <code><a class="el" href="classFESystem.html">FESystem</a></code> that does this requires us to specify first the first base element (the <code><a class="el" href="classFE__RaviartThomas.html">FE_RaviartThomas</a></code> object of given degree) and then the number of copies for this base element, and then similarly the kind and number of <code><a class="el" href="classFE__DGQ.html">FE_DGQ</a></code> elements. Note that the Raviart-Thomas element already has <code>dim</code> vector components, so that the coupled element will have <code>dim+1</code> vector components, the first <code>dim</code> of which correspond to the velocity variable whereas the last one corresponds to the pressure. It is also worth comparing the way we constructed this element from its base elements, with the way we have done so in <a class="el" href="step_8.html">step-8</a> : there, we have built it as <code>fe (<a class="el" href="classFE__Q.html">FE_Q</a>&lt;dim&gt;(1), dim)</code> , i.e. we have simply used <code>dim</code> copies of the <code><a class="el" href="classFE__Q.html">FE_Q(1)</a></code> element, one copy for the displacement in each coordinate direction.</p>

As mentioned in the introduction, we want to subdivide the matrix into blocks corresponding to the two different kinds of variables, velocity and pressure. To this end, we first have to make sure that the indices corresponding to velocities and pressures are not intermingled: First all velocity degrees of freedom, then all pressure DoFs. This way, the global matrix separates nicely into a \(2 \times 2\) system. To achieve this, we have to renumber degrees of freedom based on their vector component, an operation that conveniently is already implemented:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><a class="code" href="namespaceDoFRenumbering.html#a52c1941406d1ce2937e29a46edf111f4">DoFRenumbering::component_wise</a>(dof_handler);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>The next thing is that we want to figure out the sizes of these blocks so that we can allocate an appropriate amount of space. To this end, we call the <a class="el" href="namespaceDoFTools.html#a956ac5c6aab03ec1c04f1ad955301db9">DoFTools::count_dofs_per_fe_component()</a> function that counts how many shape functions are non-zero for a particular vector component. We have <code>dim+1</code> vector components, and <a class="el" href="namespaceDoFTools.html#a956ac5c6aab03ec1c04f1ad955301db9">DoFTools::count_dofs_per_fe_component()</a> will count how many shape functions belong to each of these components. There is one problem here. As described in the documentation of that function, it <em>wants</em> to put the number of \(x\) -velocity shape functions into <code>dofs_per_component[0]</code> , the number of \(y\) -velocity shape functions into <code>dofs_per_component[1]</code> (and similar in 3d), and the number of pressure shape functions into <code>dofs_per_component[dim]</code> . But, the Raviart-Thomas element is special in that it is non- <a class="el" href="DEALGlossary.html#GlossPrimitive">primitive</a>, i.e., for Raviart-Thomas elements all velocity shape functions are nonzero in all components. In other words, the function cannot distinguish between \(x\) and \(y\) velocity functions because there <em>is</em> no such distinction. It therefore puts the overall number of velocity into each of <code>dofs_per_component[c]</code> , \(0\le c\le \text{dim}\) . On the other hand, the number of pressure variables equals the number of shape functions that are nonzero in the dim-th component. Using this knowledge, we can get the number of velocity shape functions from any of the first <code>dim</code> elements of <code>dofs_per_component</code> , and then use this below to initialize the vector and matrix block sizes, as well as create output.</p>
<pre class="fragment">@note   If you find this concept difficult to understand, you may want to consider using the function   DoFTools::count_dofs_per_fe_block()   instead, as we do in the corresponding piece of code in   @ref step_22 "step-22"  . You might also want to read up on the difference between   @ref GlossBlock   "blocks" and   @ref GlossComponent   "components" in the glossary.

This block sparsity pattern has four blocks in a \(2 \times 2\) pattern. The blocks' sizes depend on <code>n_u</code> and <code>n_p</code> , which hold the number of velocity and pressure variables. In the second step we have to instruct the block system to update its knowledge about the sizes of the blocks it manages; this happens with the <code>dsp.collect_sizes ()</code> call.</p>

<pre class="fragment">&lt;a name="MixedLaplacecompute_errors"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;h4&gt;MixedLaplace::compute_errors&lt;/h4&gt;
</pre><p>After we have dealt with the linear solver and preconditioners, we continue with the implementation of our main class. In particular, the next task is to compute the errors in our numerical solution, in both the pressures as well as velocities. To compute errors in the solution, we have already introduced the <code><a class="el" href="namespaceVectorTools.html#a676190d2c897ac5da68a9c460fa95832">VectorTools::integrate_difference</a></code> function in <a class="el" href="step_7.html">step-7</a> and <a class="el" href="step_11.html">step-11</a> . However, there we only dealt with scalar solutions, whereas here we have a vector-valued solution with components that even denote different quantities and may have different orders of convergence (this isn't the case here, by choice of the used finite elements, but is frequently the case in mixed finite element applications). What we therefore have to do is to `mask' the components that we are interested in. This is easily done: the <code><a class="el" href="namespaceVectorTools.html#a676190d2c897ac5da68a9c460fa95832">VectorTools::integrate_difference</a></code> function takes as one of its arguments a pointer to a weight function (the parameter defaults to the null pointer, meaning unit weights). What we have to do is to pass a function object that equals one in the components we are interested in, and zero in the other ones. For example, to compute the pressure error, we should pass a function that represents the constant vector with a unit value in component <code>dim</code> , whereas for the velocity the constant vector should be one in the first <code>dim</code> components, and zero in the location of the pressure. In deal.II, the <code><a class="el" href="classComponentSelectFunction.html">ComponentSelectFunction</a></code> does exactly this: it wants to know how many vector components the function it is to represent should have (in our case this would be <code>dim+1</code> , for the joint velocity-pressure space) and which individual or range of components should be equal to one. We therefore define two such masks at the beginning of the function, following by an object representing the exact solution and a vector in which we will store the cellwise errors as computed by <code>integrate_difference</code> :</p>

All we can do is approximate this integral using quadrature. This actually presents a slight twist here: if we naively chose an object of type <code><a class="el" href="classQGauss.html">QGauss</a>&lt;dim&gt;(degree+1)</code> as one may be inclined to do (this is what we used for integrating the linear system), one realizes that the error is very small and does not follow the expected convergence curves at all. What is happening is that for the mixed finite elements used here, the Gauss points happen to be superconvergence points in which the pointwise error is much smaller (and converges with higher order) than anywhere else. These are therefore not particularly good points for integration. To avoid this problem, we simply use a trapezoidal rule and iterate it <code>degree+2</code> times in each coordinate direction (again as explained in <a class="el" href="step_7.html">step-7</a> ):</p>

</pre><p>The fact that the number of iterations is so small, of course, is due tothe good (but expensive!) preconditioner we have developed. To getconfidence in the solution, let us take a look at it. The following threeimages show (from left to right) the x-velocity, the y-velocity, and thepressure: </p><table style="width:60%" align="center">

<p>Let us start with the pressure: it is highest at the left and lowest at theright, so flow will be from left to right. In addition, though hardly visiblein the graph, we have chosen the pressure field such that the flow left-rightflow first channels towards the center and then outward again. Consequently,the x-velocity has to increase to get the flow through the narrow part,something that can easily be seen in the left image. The middle imagerepresents inward flow in y-direction at the left end of the domain, andoutward flow in y-direction at the right end of the domain.</p>
<p>As an additional remark, note how the x-velocity in the left image is onlycontinuous in x-direction, whereas the y-velocity is continuous iny-direction. The flow fields are discontinuous in the other directions. Thisvery obviously reflects the continuity properties of the Raviart-Thomaselements, which are, in fact, only in the space H(div) and not in the space \(H^1\) . Finally, the pressure field is completely discontinuous, butthat should not surprise given that we have chosen <code><a class="el" href="classFE__DGQ.html">FE_DGQ(0)</a></code> asthe finite element for that solution component.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Convergence"></a></p><h3>Convergence</h3>
<p>The program offers two obvious places where playing and observing convergenceis in order: the degree of the finite elements used (passed to the constructorof the <code>MixedLaplaceProblem</code> class from <code>main()</code> ), andthe refinement level (determined in <code>MixedLaplaceProblem::make_grid_and_dofs</code> ). What one can do is tochange these values and observe the errors computed later on in the course ofthe program run.</p>
<p>If one does this, one finds the following pattern for the \(L_2\) errorin the pressure variable: </p><table align="center" class="doxtable">

<p><a class="anchor" id="Morerealisticpermeabilityfields"></a></p><h4>More realistic permeability fields</h4>
<p>Realistic flow computations for ground water or oil reservoir simulations willnot use a constant permeability. Here's a first, rather simple way to changethis situation: we use a permeability that decays very rapidly away from acentral flowline until it hits a background value of 0.001. This is to mimicthe behavior of fluids in sandstone: in most of the domain, the sandstone ishomogeneous and, while permeable to fluids, not overly so; on the other stone,the stone has cracked, or faulted, along one line, and the fluids flow mucheasier along this large crack. Here is how we could implement something likethis: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">template</span> &lt;<span class="keywordtype">int</span> dim&gt;</div><div class="line"><span class="keywordtype">void</span></div><div class="line">KInverse&lt;dim&gt;::value_list (<span class="keyword">const</span> std::vector&lt;<a class="code" href="classPoint.html">Point&lt;dim&gt;</a> &gt; &amp;points,</div><div class="line">                           std::vector&lt;<a class="code" href="classTensor.html">Tensor&lt;2,dim&gt;</a> &gt;    &amp;values)<span class="keyword"> const</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword"></span>{</div><div class="line">  <a class="code" href="group__Exceptions.html#ga70a0bb353656e704acf927945277bbc6">Assert</a> (points.size() == values.<a class="code" href="classVector.html#a81dcfa5c77bdd426603386c0844149ae">size</a>(),</div><div class="line">          <a class="code" href="group__Exceptions.html#ga6060b2304b8600f5efa0d31eeda0207d">ExcDimensionMismatch</a> (points.size(), values.<a class="code" href="classVector.html#a81dcfa5c77bdd426603386c0844149ae">size</a>()));</div><div class="line">  </div><div class="line">  <span class="keywordflow">for</span> (<span class="keywordtype">unsigned</span> <span class="keywordtype">int</span> p=0; p&lt;points.size(); ++p)</div><div class="line">    {</div><div class="line">      values[p].clear ();</div><div class="line">  </div><div class="line">      <span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="keywordtype">double</span> distance_to_flowline</div><div class="line">        = <a class="code" href="namespaceDifferentiation_1_1SD.html#a592560ee80355620422a86087f11b9df">std::fabs</a>(points[p][1]-0.2*std::sin(10*points[p][0]));</div><div class="line">  </div><div class="line">      <span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="keywordtype">double</span> permeability = <a class="code" href="namespaceVectorTools_1_1EvaluationFlags.html#ac6721740e24732d6afabcf28ddfc1ffda8e7f5b8545162dccd5ed717792bdf420">std::max</a>(std::exp(-(distance_to_flowline*</div><div class="line">                                                      distance_to_flowline)</div><div class="line">                                                    / (0.1 0.1)),</div><div class="line">                                           0.001);</div><div class="line">  </div><div class="line">      <span class="keywordflow">for</span> (<span class="keywordtype">unsigned</span> <span class="keywordtype">int</span> <a class="code" href="namespacePhysics_1_1Elasticity_1_1Kinematics.html#a15728437b942dab0b0042eb06a407d2c">d</a>=0; <a class="code" href="namespacePhysics_1_1Elasticity_1_1Kinematics.html#a15728437b942dab0b0042eb06a407d2c">d</a>&lt;dim; ++<a class="code" href="namespacePhysics_1_1Elasticity_1_1Kinematics.html#a15728437b942dab0b0042eb06a407d2c">d</a>)</div><div class="line">        values[p][<a class="code" href="namespacePhysics_1_1Elasticity_1_1Kinematics.html#a15728437b942dab0b0042eb06a407d2c">d</a>][<a class="code" href="namespacePhysics_1_1Elasticity_1_1Kinematics.html#a15728437b942dab0b0042eb06a407d2c">d</a>] = 1./permeability;</div><div class="line">    }</div><div class="line">}</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> Remember that the function returns the inverse of the permeability tensor.</p>

<p>It is obvious how fluids flow essentially only along the middle line, and notanywhere else.</p>
<p>Another possibility would be to use a random permeability field. A simple wayto achieve this would be to scatter a number of centers around the domain andthen use a permeability field that is the sum of (negative) exponentials foreach of these centers. Flow would then try to hop from one center of highpermeability to the next one. This is an entirely unscientific attempt atdescribing a random medium, but one possibility to implement this behaviorwould look like this: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">template</span> &lt;<span class="keywordtype">int</span> dim&gt;</div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">class </span>KInverse : <span class="keyword">public</span> <a class="code" href="classTensorFunction.html">TensorFunction</a>&lt;2,dim&gt;</div><div class="line">{</div><div class="line">  <span class="keyword">public</span>:</div><div class="line">    KInverse ();</div><div class="line">  </div><div class="line">    <span class="keyword">virtual</span> <span class="keywordtype">void</span> <a class="code" href="classTensorFunction.html#a3afbbe3ba38a517e8a97db9adf2cb340">value_list</a> (<span class="keyword">const</span> std::vector&lt;<a class="code" href="classPoint.html">Point&lt;dim&gt;</a> &gt;

<p>As mentioned in the introduction, the Schur complement solver used here is notthe best one conceivable (nor is it intended to be a particularly goodone). Better ones can be found in the literature and can be built using thesame block matrix techniques that were introduced here. We pick up on thistheme again in <a class="el" href="step_22.html">step-22</a> , where we first build a Schur complement solver for theStokes equation as we did here, and then in the <a href="step_22.html#improved-solver">Improved Solvers</a> section discuss betterways based on solving the system as a whole but preconditioning based onindividual blocks. We will also come back to this in <a class="el" href="step_43.html">step-43</a> .</p>

<p>这个程序致力于两个方面：使用混合有限元&ndash;特别是Raviart-Thomas元&ndash;以及使用块状矩阵来定义求解器、预处理器和使用系统矩阵的子结构的嵌套版本。我们要解决的方程仍然是泊松方程，虽然有一个矩阵值的系数。</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} -\nabla \cdot K({\mathbf x}) \nabla p &amp;=&amp; f \qquad {\textrm{in}\ } \Omega, \\ p &amp;=&amp; g \qquad {\textrm{on}\ }\partial\Omega. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p>\(K({\mathbf x})\) 被假定为均匀正定，即有 \(\alpha&gt;0\) ，使得 \(K(x)\) 的特征值 \(\lambda_i({\mathbf x})\) 满足 \(\lambda_i({\mathbf x})\ge \alpha\) 。使用符号 \(p\) 而不是通常的 \(u\) 作为解变量将在下一节中变得清晰。</p>
<p>在讨论了方程和我们要用来解决它的公式之后，这个介绍将包括块状矩阵和向量的使用，求解器和预处理器的定义，以及最后我们要解决的实际测试案例。</p>
<p>我们将在第21步中扩展这个教程程序，不仅要解决混合拉普拉斯方程，还要增加另一个描述两种流体混合物运输的方程。</p>
<p>这里所涉及的方程属于矢量值问题的范畴。这个主题的顶层概述可以在 <a class="el" href="group__vector__valued.html">Handling vector valued problems</a> 模块中找到。</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Theequations"></a></p><h3>The equations</h3>
<p>在上述形式中，泊松方程（即具有非零右手边的拉普拉斯方程）通常被认为是流体在多孔介质中流动的良好模型方程。当然，人们通常通过<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations">Navier-Stokes equations</a>来模拟流体流动，或者，如果流体速度很慢或粘度很大，则通过<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes_flow">Stokes equations</a>（我们在步骤22中涉及）。在这两个模型中，第一个模型的作用力是惯性和粘性摩擦力，而在第二个模型中，只有粘性摩擦力&ndash;即一个流体粒子对附近的粒子施加的力。如果你在一个大的领域里有自由流动，例如管道、河流或空气中，这是很合适的。另一方面，如果流体被限制在孔隙中，那么孔壁对流体施加的摩擦力变得越来越重要，而内部粘性摩擦力变得越来越不重要。如果这两种效应都很重要，那么建立模型首先会导致<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy%27s_law#Brinkman_form_of_Darcy&apos;s_law">Brinkman model</a>，而在非常小的孔隙的限制下会导致<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy%27s_law">Darcy equations</a>。后者只是泊松方程或拉普拉斯方程的不同名称，其内涵是人们想应用它的领域：多孔介质中的缓慢流动。本质上，它说速度与驱动流体通过多孔介质的负压梯度成正比。</p>
<p>达西方程对驱动流动的这种压力进行建模。由于解变量是压力，我们在这里使用 \(p\) 这个名字，而不是更常用于偏微分方程解的 \(u\) 这个名字）。这种拉普拉斯方程观点的典型应用是为地下水流建模，或者为油藏中的碳氢化合物流动建模。在这些应用中， \(K\) 是渗透性张量，即衡量土壤或岩石基质对流体流动的阻力大小。</p>
<p>在上述应用中，数值方案的一个理想特征是它应该是局部保守的，也就是说，无论什么东西流入一个单元，也会从该单元流出（或者如果源不为零，则差值等于每个单元的源项的积分）。然而，事实证明，拉普拉斯方程的通常离散化（如步骤3、步骤4或步骤6中使用的那些）并不满足这一特性。但是，人们可以通过选择问题的不同表述和有限元空间的特定组合来实现这一点。</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Formulationweakformanddiscreteproblem"></a></p><h3>Formulation, weak form, and discrete problem</h3>
<p>为此，我们首先引入了第二个变量，称为速度， \({\mathbf u}=-K\nabla p\) 。根据其定义，速度是压力梯度的负方向的一个矢量，乘以渗透性张量。如果渗透率张量与单位矩阵成正比，这个方程就很容易理解和直观：渗透率越高，速度越高；速度与压力梯度成正比，从高压区到低压区（因此是负号）。</p>
<p>有了这第二个变量，就可以找到拉普拉斯方程的另一个版本，称为<em>mixed formulation</em>。</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} K^{-1} {\mathbf u} + \nabla p &amp;=&amp; 0 \qquad {\textrm{in}\ } \Omega, \\ -{\textrm{div}}\ {\mathbf u} &amp;=&amp; -f \qquad {\textrm{in}\ }\Omega, \\ p &amp;=&amp; g \qquad {\textrm{on}\ } \partial\Omega. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p>这里，我们将定义速度的方程 \({\mathbf u}\) 乘以 \(K^{-1}\) ，因为这使得方程组是对称的：其中一个方程有梯度，第二个方程有负发散，这两个当然是彼此相邻的，结果是一个对称的双线性形式，因此在 \(K\) 是对称张量的共同假设下，是一个对称的系统矩阵。</p>
<p>这个问题的弱表述是通过将两个方程与测试函数相乘，并对一些项进行分项积分来找到的。</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} A(\{{\mathbf u},p\},\{{\mathbf v},q\}) = F(\{{\mathbf v},q\}), \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p>其中</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} A(\{{\mathbf u},p\},\{{\mathbf v},q\}) &amp;=&amp; ({\mathbf v}, K^{-1}{\mathbf u})_\Omega - ({\textrm{div}}\ {\mathbf v}, p)_\Omega - (q,{\textrm{div}}\ {\mathbf u})_\Omega \\ F(\{{\mathbf v},q\}) &amp;=&amp; -(g,{\mathbf v}\cdot {\mathbf n})_{\partial\Omega} - (f,q)_\Omega. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p>这里， \({\mathbf n}\) 是边界处的外向法向量。请注意，在这个公式中，原问题的迪里希特边界值被纳入到弱形式中。</p>
<p>为了得到良好的解决，我们必须在空间 \(H({\textrm{div}})=\{{\mathbf w}\in L^2(\Omega)^d:\ {\textrm{div}}\ {\mathbf w}\in L^2\}\) 中寻找 \(\mathbf u\) 、 \(\mathbf v\) 和 \(L^2\) 的解和检验函数。几乎每一本关于有限元理论的书都说过一个众所周知的事实，如果选择离散的有限元空间来逼近 \({\mathbf u},p\) 是不恰当的，那么产生的离散问题是不稳定的，离散的解将不会收敛到精确的解。这里考虑的问题的一些细节&ndash;属于 "鞍点问题 "的范畴</p>
<p>&ndash;可以在维基百科上找到<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladyzhenskaya%E2%80%93Babu%C5%A1ka%E2%80%93Brezzi_condition">Ladyzhenskaya-Babuska-Brezzi (LBB) condition</a>的页面）。)</p>
<p>为了克服这个问题，已经为 \({\mathbf u},p\) 开发了一些不同的有限元对，导致了稳定的离散问题。其中一个对子是对速度 \({\mathbf u}\) 使用Raviart-Thomas空间，对压力 \(p\) 使用类 \(DQ(k)\) 的不连续元素。关于这些空间的细节，我们特别参考Brezzi和Fortin的关于混合有限元方法的书，但许多其他关于有限元理论的书，例如Brenner和Scott的经典书，也说明了相关结果。在任何情况下，在适当选择函数空间的情况下，离散的表述如下。找到 \({\mathbf u}_h,p_h\) ，以便</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} A(\{{\mathbf u}_h,p_h\},\{{\mathbf v}_h,q_h\}) = F(\{{\mathbf v}_h,q_h\}) \qquad\qquad \forall {\mathbf v}_h,q_h. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p>在继续之前，让我们简单地停顿一下，说明上面的函数空间的选择为我们提供了所需的局部守恒特性。特别是，由于压力空间由不连续的片断多项式组成，我们可以选择测试函数 \(q\) 作为在任何给定单元 \(K\) 上等于1，其他地方为0的函数。如果我们也到处选择 \({\mathbf v}=0\) （记住，上面的弱式对<em>all</em>离散测试函数 \(q,v\) 必须成立），那么把这些测试函数的选择放入上面的弱式中，特别意味着</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} - (1,{\textrm{div}}\ {\mathbf u}_h)_K = -(1,f)_K, \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p>当然，我们可以将其以更明确的形式写为</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} \int_K {\textrm{div}}\ {\mathbf u}_h = \int_K f. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p>应用发散定理的结果是，对于每个单元 \({\mathbf u}_h\) 的选择， \(K\) 必须满足以下关系</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} \int_{\partial K} {\mathbf u}_h\cdot{\mathbf n} = \int_K f. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p>如果你现在记得 \({\mathbf u}\) 是速度，那么左边的积分正好是穿过单元格边界的（离散）通量 \(K\) 。那么声明是，通量必须等于对 \(K\) 内的源的积分。特别是，如果没有源（即 \(f=0\) 在 \(K\) 中），那么声明是<em>total</em>通量为零，也就是说，任何流入一个单元的东西都必须通过单元边界的其他部分流出。这就是我们所说的<em>local conservation</em>，因为它对每个细胞都是成立的。</p>
<p>另一方面，通常的连续 \(Q_k\) 元素在用于压力时不会产生这种性质（例如，我们在步骤-43中所做的），因为我们不能选择一个离散的测试函数 \(q_h\) ，在单元 \(K\) 上为1，其他地方为0：它将是不连续的，因此不在有限元空间内。严格来说，我们只能说上面的证明对连续元素不起作用。这些元素是否仍然可能导致局部守恒是一个不同的问题，因为人们可以认为不同的证明可能仍然有效；然而，在现实中，这个属性确实不成立）。)</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Assemblingthelinearsystem"></a></p><h3>Assembling the linear system</h3>
<p>deal.II库（当然）实现了任意阶的Raviart-Thomas元素 \(RT(k)\) ，以及不连续元素 \(DG(k)\) 。如果我们暂时忘记它们的特殊属性，那么我们就必须解决一个离散的问题</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} A(x_h,w_h) = F(w_h), \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p>的双线性形式和右手边，以及 \(x_h=\{{\mathbf u}_h,p_h\}\) , \(w_h=\{{\mathbf v}_h,q_h\}\) 。 \(x_h\) 和 \(w_h\) 都来自空间 \(X_h=RT(k)\times DQ(k)\) ，其中 \(RT(k)\) 本身就是一个 \(dim\) 维函数的空间，以适应流速为矢量值的事实。那么必要的问题是：我们如何在程序中做到这一点？</p>
<p>矢量值元素已经在以前的教程程序中讨论过了，第一次是在步骤8中详细讨论。那里的主要区别是，矢量值空间 \(V_h\) 的所有分量都是统一的：位移矢量的 \(dim\) 分量都是相等的，来自同一个函数空间。因此，我们可以做的是将 \(V_h\) 建立为 \(dim\) 乘以通常的 \(Q(1)\) 有限元空间的外积，并以此确保我们所有的形状函数只有一个非零矢量分量。因此，我们在步骤8中所做的不是处理矢量值的形状函数，而是查看（标量）唯一的非零分量，并使用 <code>fe.system_to_component_index(i).first</code> 调用来计算这实际上是哪个分量。</p>
<p>这对Raviart-Thomas元素不起作用：由于它们的构造满足空间 \(H({\textrm{div}})\) 的某些规则性属性， \(RT(k)\) 的形状函数通常在其所有矢量分量中都是不为零。由于这个原因，如果应用 <code>fe.system_to_component_index(i).first</code> 来确定形状函数 \(i\) 的唯一非零分量，就会产生一个例外。我们真正需要做的是在 <em> 中获得一个形状函数的所有 </em> 向量分量。在deal.II的字典中，我们称这样的有限元为 <em> 非原始 </em> ，而那些标量的有限元或者每个矢量值的形状函数只在一个矢量分量中不为零的有限元被称为 <em> 原始 </em> 。</p>
<p>那么，对于非原始元素，我们要怎么做呢？为了弄清楚这个问题，让我们回到教程程序中，几乎是最开始的时候。在那里，我们了解到我们使用 <code><a class="el" href="classFEValues.html">FEValues</a></code> 类来确定正交点的形状函数的值和梯度。例如，我们会调用 <code>fe_values.shape_value(i,q_point)</code> 来获得 <code>i</code> 第三个形状函数在编号为 <code>q_point</code> 的正交点的值。后来，在<a class="el" href="step_8.html">step-8</a>和其他教程程序中，我们了解到这个函数调用也适用于矢量值的形状函数（原始有限元），它返回形状函数 <code>i</code> 在正交点 <code>q_point</code> 的唯一非零分量的值。</p>
<p>对于非原始形状函数，这显然是行不通的：形状函数 <code>i</code> 没有单一的非零向量分量，因此调用 <code>fe_values.shape_value(i,q_point)</code> 也就没有什么意义。然而，deal.II提供了第二个函数调用， <code>fe_values.shape_value_component(i,q_point,comp)</code> ，返回正交点 <code>comp</code>th vector component of shape function <code>i</code> 的值 <code>q_point</code>, where <code>comp</code> 是一个介于零和当前有限元的矢量分量数量之间的索引；例如，我们将用于描述速度和压力的元素将有 \(dim+1\) 分量。值得注意的是，这个函数调用也可用于原始形状函数：它将简单地对除一个分量外的所有分量返回零；对于非原始形状函数，它一般会对不止一个分量返回非零值。</p>
<p>我们现在可以尝试用矢量分量来重写上面的双线性形式。例如，在2d中，第一项可以这样改写（注意， \(u_0=x_0, u_1=x_1, p=x_2\) ）。</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} ({\mathbf u}_h^i, K^{-1}{\mathbf u}_h^j) = &amp;\left((x_h^i)_0, K^{-1}_{00} (x_h^j)_0\right) + \left((x_h^i)_0, K^{-1}_{01} (x_h^j)_1\right) + \\ &amp;\left((x_h^i)_1, K^{-1}_{10} (x_h^j)_0\right) + \left((x_h^i)_1, K^{-1}_{11} (x_h^j)_1\right). \end{eqnarray*}
</p>

<p>这段代码的作用是，给定一个 <code>fe_values</code> 对象，提取形状函数 <code>i</code> 在正交点 <code>q</code> 的第一个 \(dim\) 分量的值，也就是该形状函数的速度部分。换句话说，如果我们把形状函数 \(x_h^i\) 写成元组 \(\{{\mathbf u}_h^i,p_h^i\}\) ，那么该函数返回这个元组的速度部分。请注意，速度当然是一个 <code>dim</code> 维的张量，函数返回一个相应的对象。同样地，在我们用压力提取器下标的地方，我们提取标量压力分量。整个机制在 <a class="el" href="group__vector__valued.html">Handling vector valued problems</a> 模块中有更详细的描述。</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="Linearsolversandpreconditioners"></a></p><h3>Linear solvers and preconditioners</h3>
<p>在组装好线性系统后，我们就面临着解决它的任务。这里的问题是，矩阵拥有两个不理想的特性。</p>
<ul>
<li>它是<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definiteness_of_a_matrix">indefinite</a>，也就是说，它有正负两个特征值。 我们不想在这里证明这个属性，但要注意，对于所有形式为 \(\left(\begin{array}{cc} M &amp; B \\ B^T &amp; 0 \end{array}\right)\) 的矩阵，如这里的 \(M\) 是正定的矩阵，这都是真的。</li>
<li>矩阵的右下方有一个零块（在双线性形式中没有将压力 \(p\) 与压力测试函数 \(q\) 耦合的项）。</li>
</ul>
<p>至少它是对称的，但是上面的第一个问题仍然意味着共轭梯度法是行不通的，因为它只适用于矩阵是对称和正定的问题。我们将不得不求助于其他迭代求解器，如MinRes、SymmLQ或GMRES，它们可以处理不确定的系统。然而，下一个问题立即浮现。由于零块，对角线上有零，通常的 "简单 "预处理程序（Jacobi、SSOR）都不能工作，因为它们需要除以对角线上的元素。</p>
<p>对于我们期望用这个程序运行的矩阵大小来说，迄今为止最简单的方法是直接使用一个直接求解器（特别是与deal.II捆绑的SparseDirectUMFPACK类）。<a class="el" href="step_29.html">step-29</a>走的就是这条路线，它表明只需3、4行代码就可以完成<em>any</em>线性系统的求解。</p>
<p>但是，这是一个教程。我们教的是如何做事情。因此，在下文中，我们将介绍一些可用于类似这种情况的技术。也就是说，我们将考虑线性系统不是由一个大矩阵和向量组成的，而是要将矩阵分解为<em>blocks</em>，这些矩阵对应于系统中出现的各个运算符。我们注意到，所产生的求解器并不是最优的&ndash;有更好的方法来有效地计算该系统，例如在步骤22的结果部分所解释的方法，或者我们在步骤43中用于类似于当前问题的方法。在这里，我们的目标只是介绍新的求解技术以及如何在交易中实现它们。</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="SolvingusingtheSchurcomplement"></a></p><h4>Solving using the Schur complement</h4>
<p>鉴于使用上述标准求解器和预处理器的困难，让我们再看一下矩阵。如果我们对自由度进行排序，使所有的速度变量排在所有的压力变量之前，那么我们可以将线性系统 \(Ax=b\) 细分为以下几个块。</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} \left(\begin{array}{cc} M &amp; B \\ B^T &amp; 0 \end{array}\right) \left(\begin{array}{cc} U \\ P \end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{cc} F \\ G \end{array}\right), \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p>其中 \(U,P\) 分别是速度和压力自由度的值， \(M\) 是速度空间上的质量矩阵， \(B^T\) 对应于负发散算子， \(B\) 是其转置，对应于梯度。</p>
<p>通过区块消除法，我们就可以按以下方式对这个系统重新排序（用系统的第一行乘以 \(B^TM^{-1}\) ，然后用第二行减去）。</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} B^TM^{-1}B P &amp;=&amp; B^TM^{-1} F - G, \\ MU &amp;=&amp; F - BP. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p>这里，矩阵 \(S=B^TM^{-1}B\) （称为 \(A\) 的<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schur_complement">Schur complement</a>）显然是对称的，由于 \(M\) 的正定性和 \(B\) 具有全列秩， \(S\) 也是正定的。</p>
<p>因此，如果我们能计算出 \(S\) ，我们就可以对其应用共轭梯度法。然而，计算 \(S\) 是昂贵的，因为它需要我们计算（可能很大的）矩阵 \(M\) 的逆；而且 \(S\) 实际上也是一个完整的矩阵，因为即使 \(M\) 是稀疏的，它的逆 \(M^{-1}\) 通常是一个密集的矩阵。另一方面，CG算法并不要求我们真正拥有 \(S\) 的表示：只需与它形成矩阵-向量乘积即可。我们可以利用矩阵乘积是关联的这一事实，分步进行（也就是说，我们可以通过设置括号来使乘积的计算更加方便）。为了计算 \(Sv=(B^TM^{-1}B)v=B^T(M^{-1}(Bv))\) ，我们</p><ol>
<li>
计算 \(w = B v\) ； </li>
<li>
解 \(My = w\) 为 \(y=M^{-1}w\) ，使用CG方法应用于正定和对称质量矩阵 \(M\) ； </li>
<li>
计算 \(z=B^Ty\) ，得到 \(z=Sv\) 。 </li>
</ol>
<p>注意我们如何从右到左评估表达式 \(B^TM^{-1}Bv\) 以避免矩阵-矩阵乘积；这样，我们所要做的就是评估矩阵-向量乘积。</p>
<p>在下文中，我们将不得不想出表示矩阵 \(S\) 的方法，以便它可以用于共轭梯度求解器，以及定义我们可以预设涉及 \(S\) 的线性系统解决方案的方法，并处理与矩阵 \(M\) 的线性系统求解（上述第二步骤）。</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>这个考虑的关键点是要认识到，为了实现CG或GMRES这样的迭代求解器，我们实际上从来不需要矩阵的实际<em>elements</em>!所需要的只是我们能够形成矩阵-向量乘积。对于预处理程序也是如此。在deal.II中，我们对这一要求进行了编码，只要求给予求解器类的矩阵和预处理器有一个 <code>vmult()</code> 成员函数来做矩阵-向量乘积。一个类如何选择实现这个函数对求解器来说并不重要。因此，类可以通过，例如，做一连串的乘积和线性求解来实现它，正如上面所讨论的。</dd></dl>

<p><a class="anchor" id="ApreconditionerfortheSchurcomplement"></a></p><h4>A preconditioner for the Schur complement</h4>
<p>有人可能会问，如果我们有一个Schur补数的预处理程序，是否会有帮助 \(S=B^TM^{-1}B\) 。一般来说，答案是：当然。问题是，我们对这个舒尔补码矩阵一无所知。我们不知道它的条目，我们所知道的只是它的作用。另一方面，我们必须认识到，我们的求解器是昂贵的，因为在每次迭代中，我们必须与舒尔补矩阵做一次矩阵-向量乘积，这意味着我们必须在每次迭代中对质量矩阵做一次反转。</p>
<p>对这样一个矩阵的预处理有不同的方法。一个极端是使用便宜的东西，因此对每次迭代的工作没有实际影响。另一个极端是使用本身非常昂贵的预处理程序，但作为回报，它确实降低了用 \(S\) 求解所需的迭代次数。</p>
<p>我们将按照第二种方法进行尝试，既是为了提高程序的性能，也是为了展示一些技术。为此，让我们回顾一下，理想的预处理程序当然是 \(S^{-1}\) ，但这是无法实现的。然而，如何</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} \tilde S^{-1} = [B^T ({\textrm{diag}\ }M)^{-1}B]^{-1} \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p>作为一个预处理程序？这就意味着，每次我们要做一个预处理步骤时，实际上都要用 \(\tilde S\) 来解。起初，这看起来几乎和立即用 \(S\) 求解一样昂贵。然而，请注意，在内迭代中，我们不必计算 \(M^{-1}\) ，而只需计算其对角线的逆值，这很便宜。</p>
<p>值得庆幸的是，LinearOperator框架使得这一点非常容易写出来。我们之前已经对 <code>preconditioner_M</code> 矩阵使用了雅可比预处理程序（ \(M\) ）。所以剩下的就是写出近似的舒尔补码应该是什么样子。</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="keyword">auto</span> op_aS =</div><div class="line">  <a class="code" href="group__LAOperators.html#ga6bdc65fb2db56230e6bc7d545e81295d">transpose_operator</a>(op_B) * <a class="code" href="group__LAOperators.html#ga6b74b7ed76e4aeea2c67c0bbb03e3e24">linear_operator</a>(preconditioner_M) * op_B;</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>注意这个运算符的不同之处在于，它只是做了一次雅可比扫频（即与对角线的逆数相乘），而不是与整个 \(M^{-1}\) 相乘。]的定义：它是与 \(M\) 的对角线的倒数相乘；换句话说，对向量 \(x\) 的 \(({\textrm{diag}\ }M)^{-1}x\) 操作正是PreconditionJacobi所做的）。)</p>
<p>有了这些，我们几乎已经完成了预处理程序：它应该是近似Schur补码的逆。我们再次通过使用inverse_operator()函数创建一个线性算子来实现这一点。然而这一次我们想为CG求解器选择一个相对较小的容忍度（即反转 <code>op_aS</code> ）。理由是 <code>op_aS</code> is only coarse approximation to <code>op_S</code> ，所以我们实际上不需要完全反转它。然而，这产生了一个微妙的问题： <code>preconditioner_S</code> 将被用于最后的外层CG迭代以创建一个正交基础。但为了使其发挥作用，每次调用都必须是精确的线性操作。我们通过使用IterationNumberControl来确保这一点，它允许我们将执行的CG迭代次数固定为一个固定的小数字（在我们的例子中为30）。</p>

<p>很明显，应用这个近似Schur补数的逆运算是一个非常昂贵的预处理程序，几乎和反转Schur补数本身一样昂贵。我们可以期望它能大大减少Schur补数所需的外部迭代次数。事实上，它确实如此：在使用0阶元素的7次细化网格的典型运行中，外部迭代次数从592次下降到39次。另一方面，我们现在必须应用一个非常昂贵的预处理程序25次。因此，更好的衡量标准只是程序的运行时间：在目前的笔记本电脑上（截至2019年1月），对于这个测试案例，它从3.57秒下降到2.05秒。这似乎并不令人印象深刻，但在更细的网格和更高阶的元素上，节省的时间变得更加明显了。例如，一个7倍细化的网格和使用2阶元素（相当于约40万个自由度）产生了1134次到83次的外部迭代的改进，运行时间从168秒到40秒。虽然不是惊天动地，但意义重大。</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Definitionofthetestcase"></a></p><h3>Definition of the test case</h3>
<p>在这个教程程序中，我们将求解上述混合公式中的拉普拉斯方程。由于我们想在程序中监测解的收敛性，我们选择右手边、边界条件和系数，以便恢复我们已知的解函数。特别是，我们选择压力解</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} p = -\left(\frac \alpha 2 xy^2 + \beta x - \frac \alpha 6 x^3\right), \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p>而对于系数，为了简单起见，我们选择单位矩阵 \(K_{ij}=\delta_{ij}\) 。因此，确切的速度满足于</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} {\mathbf u} = \left(\begin{array}{cc} \frac \alpha 2 y^2 + \beta - \frac \alpha 2 x^2 \\ \alpha xy \end{array}\right). \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p>选择这个解决方案是因为它完全没有发散，使得它成为不可压缩流体流动的一个现实的测试案例。因此，右手边等于 \(f=0\) ，作为边界值，我们必须选择 \(g=p|_{\partial\Omega}\) 。</p>
<p>对于本程序中的计算，我们选择 \(\alpha=0.3,\beta=1\) 。你可以在<a class="anchor" id="#Results"></a>results section below中找到结果的解决方案，在注释的程序之后。</p>

<p>In addition to the other equation data, we also want to use a permeability tensor, or better &ndash; because this is all that appears in the weak form &ndash; the inverse of the permeability tensor, <code>KInverse</code>. For the purpose of verifying the exactness of the solution and determining convergence orders, this tensor is more in the way than helpful. We will therefore simply set it to the identity matrix.</p>
<p>However, a spatially varying permeability tensor is indispensable in real-life porous media flow simulations, and we would like to use the opportunity to demonstrate the technique to use tensor valued functions.</p>
<p>Possibly unsurprisingly, deal.II also has a base class not only for scalar and generally vector-valued functions (the <code><a class="el" href="classFunction.html">Function</a></code> base class) but also for functions that return tensors of fixed dimension and rank, the <code><a class="el" href="classTensorFunction.html">TensorFunction</a></code> template. Here, the function under consideration returns a dim-by-dim matrix, i.e. a tensor of rank 2 and dimension <code>dim</code>. We then choose the template arguments of the base class appropriately.</p>
<p>The interface that the <code><a class="el" href="classTensorFunction.html">TensorFunction</a></code> class provides is essentially equivalent to the <code><a class="el" href="classFunction.html">Function</a></code> class. In particular, there exists a <code>value_list</code> function that takes a list of points at which to evaluate the function, and returns the values of the function in the second argument, a list of tensors:</p>

As in previous examples, we add a check to the beginning of the class to make sure that the sizes of input and output parameters are the same (see <a class="el" href="step_5.html">step-5</a> for a discussion of this technique). Then we loop over all evaluation points, and for each one set the output tensor to the identity matrix.</p>
<p>There is an oddity at the top of the function (the <code>(void)points;</code> statement) that is worth discussing. The values we put into the output <code>values</code> array does not actually depend on the <code>points</code> arrays of coordinates at which the function is evaluated. In other words, the <code>points</code> argument is in fact unused, and we could have just not given it a name if we had wanted. But we want to use the <code>points</code> object for checking that the <code>values</code> object has the correct size. The problem is that in release mode, <code>AssertDimension</code> is defined as a macro that expands to nothing; the compiler will then complain that the <code>points</code> object is unused. The idiomatic approach to silencing this warning is to have a statement that evaluates (reads) variable but doesn't actually do anything: That's what <code>(void)points;</code> does: It reads from <code>points</code>, and then casts the result of the read to <code>void</code>, i.e., nothing. This statement is, in other words, completely pointless and implies no actual action except to explain to the compiler that yes, this variable is in fact used even in release mode. (In debug mode, the <code>AssertDimension</code> macro expands to something that reads from the variable, and so the funny statement would not be necessary in debug mode.)</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="MixedLaplaceProblemMixedLaplaceProblem"></a> </p><h4>MixedLaplaceProblem::MixedLaplaceProblem</h4>
<p>In the constructor of this class, we first store the value that was passed in concerning the degree of the finite elements we shall use (a degree of zero, for example, means to use RT(0) and DG(0)), and then construct the vector valued element belonging to the space \(X_h\) described in the introduction. The rest of the constructor is as in the early tutorial programs.</p>
<p>The only thing worth describing here is the constructor call of the <code>fe</code> variable. The <code><a class="el" href="classFESystem.html">FESystem</a></code> class to which this variable belongs has a number of different constructors that all refer to binding simpler elements together into one larger element. In the present case, we want to couple a single RT(degree) element with a single DQ(degree) element. The constructor to <code><a class="el" href="classFESystem.html">FESystem</a></code> that does this requires us to specify first the first base element (the <code><a class="el" href="classFE__RaviartThomas.html">FE_RaviartThomas</a></code> object of given degree) and then the number of copies for this base element, and then similarly the kind and number of <code><a class="el" href="classFE__DGQ.html">FE_DGQ</a></code> elements. Note that the Raviart-Thomas element already has <code>dim</code> vector components, so that the coupled element will have <code>dim+1</code> vector components, the first <code>dim</code> of which correspond to the velocity variable whereas the last one corresponds to the pressure.</p>
<p>It is also worth comparing the way we constructed this element from its base elements, with the way we have done so in <a class="el" href="step_8.html">step-8</a>: there, we have built it as <code>fe (<a class="el" href="classFE__Q.html">FE_Q</a>&lt;dim&gt;(1), dim)</code>, i.e. we have simply used <code>dim</code> copies of the <code><a class="el" href="classFE__Q.html">FE_Q(1)</a></code> element, one copy for the displacement in each coordinate direction.</p>

<p>This next function starts out with well-known functions calls that create and refine a mesh, and then associate degrees of freedom with it:</p>

As mentioned in the introduction, we want to subdivide the matrix into blocks corresponding to the two different kinds of variables, velocity and pressure. To this end, we first have to make sure that the indices corresponding to velocities and pressures are not intermingled: First all velocity degrees of freedom, then all pressure DoFs. This way, the global matrix separates nicely into a \(2 \times 2\) system. To achieve this, we have to renumber degrees of freedom based on their vector component, an operation that conveniently is already implemented:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><a class="code" href="namespaceDoFRenumbering.html#a52c1941406d1ce2937e29a46edf111f4">DoFRenumbering::component_wise</a>(dof_handler);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>The next thing is that we want to figure out the sizes of these blocks so that we can allocate an appropriate amount of space. To this end, we call the <a class="el" href="namespaceDoFTools.html#a956ac5c6aab03ec1c04f1ad955301db9">DoFTools::count_dofs_per_fe_component()</a> function that counts how many shape functions are non-zero for a particular vector component. We have <code>dim+1</code> vector components, and <a class="el" href="namespaceDoFTools.html#a956ac5c6aab03ec1c04f1ad955301db9">DoFTools::count_dofs_per_fe_component()</a> will count how many shape functions belong to each of these components.</p>
<p>There is one problem here. As described in the documentation of that function, it <em>wants</em> to put the number of \(x\)-velocity shape functions into <code>dofs_per_component[0]</code>, the number of \(y\)-velocity shape functions into <code>dofs_per_component[1]</code> (and similar in 3d), and the number of pressure shape functions into <code>dofs_per_component[dim]</code>. But, the Raviart-Thomas element is special in that it is non-<a class="el" href="DEALGlossary.html#GlossPrimitive">primitive</a>, i.e., for Raviart-Thomas elements all velocity shape functions are nonzero in all components. In other words, the function cannot distinguish between \(x\) and \(y\) velocity functions because there <em>is</em> no such distinction. It therefore puts the overall number of velocity into each of <code>dofs_per_component[c]</code>, \(0\le c\le \text{dim}\). On the other hand, the number of pressure variables equals the number of shape functions that are nonzero in the dim-th component.</p>
<p>Using this knowledge, we can get the number of velocity shape functions from any of the first <code>dim</code> elements of <code>dofs_per_component</code>, and then use this below to initialize the vector and matrix block sizes, as well as create output.</p>

This block sparsity pattern has four blocks in a \(2 \times 2\) pattern. The blocks' sizes depend on <code>n_u</code> and <code>n_p</code>, which hold the number of velocity and pressure variables.

After that, we define the usual abbreviations for variables, and the allocate space for the local matrix and right hand side contributions, and the array that holds the global numbers of the degrees of freedom local to the present cell.</p>

<p>To compute errors in the solution, we have already introduced the <code><a class="el" href="namespaceVectorTools.html#a676190d2c897ac5da68a9c460fa95832">VectorTools::integrate_difference</a></code> function in <a class="el" href="step_7.html">step-7</a> and <a class="el" href="step_11.html">step-11</a>. However, there we only dealt with scalar solutions, whereas here we have a vector-valued solution with components that even denote different quantities and may have different orders of convergence (this isn't the case here, by choice of the used finite elements, but is frequently the case in mixed finite element applications). What we therefore have to do is to `mask' the components that we are interested in. This is easily done: the <code><a class="el" href="namespaceVectorTools.html#a676190d2c897ac5da68a9c460fa95832">VectorTools::integrate_difference</a></code> function takes as one of its arguments a pointer to a weight function (the parameter defaults to the null pointer, meaning unit weights). What we have to do is to pass a function object that equals one in the components we are interested in, and zero in the other ones. For example, to compute the pressure error, we should pass a function that represents the constant vector with a unit value in component <code>dim</code>, whereas for the velocity the constant vector should be one in the first <code>dim</code> components, and zero in the location of the pressure.</p>
<p>In deal.II, the <code><a class="el" href="classComponentSelectFunction.html">ComponentSelectFunction</a></code> does exactly this: it wants to know how many vector components the function it is to represent should have (in our case this would be <code>dim+1</code>, for the joint velocity-pressure space) and which individual or range of components should be equal to one. We therefore define two such masks at the beginning of the function, following by an object representing the exact solution and a vector in which we will store the cellwise errors as computed by <code>integrate_difference</code>:</p>

All we can do is approximate this integral using quadrature. This actually presents a slight twist here: if we naively chose an object of type <code><a class="el" href="classQGauss.html">QGauss</a>&lt;dim&gt;(degree+1)</code> as one may be inclined to do (this is what we used for integrating the linear system), one realizes that the error is very small and does not follow the expected convergence curves at all. What is happening is that for the mixed finite elements used here, the Gauss points happen to be superconvergence points in which the pointwise error is much smaller (and converges with higher order) than anywhere else. These are therefore not particularly good points for integration. To avoid this problem, we simply use a trapezoidal rule and iterate it <code>degree+2</code> times in each coordinate direction (again as explained in <a class="el" href="step_7.html">step-7</a>):</p>

<p>让我们从压力开始：它在左边是最高的，在右边是最低的，所以流动将是从左到右。此外，虽然在图中几乎看不出来，但我们选择的压力场是这样的：从左到右的流动首先是向中心流动，然后再向外流动。因此，X-速度必须增加以使流动通过狭窄的部分，这一点在左图中很容易看到。中间的图像表示在域的左端有Y方向的内流，而在域的右端有Y方向的外流。</p>
<p>作为补充说明，请注意左图中的x-速度在x方向上是连续的，而y-速度在y方向上是连续的。其他方向上的流场是不连续的。这非常明显地反映了Raviart-Thomas元素的连续性特性，事实上，它只在空间H(div)而不是在空间 \(H^1\) 。最后，压力场是完全不连续的，但鉴于我们选择了 <code><a class="el" href="classFE__DGQ.html">FE_DGQ(0)</a></code> 作为该解分量的有限元，这不应该令人惊讶。</p>

<p>用于地下水或油藏模拟的现实流动计算不会使用恒定的渗透率。下面是改变这种情况的第一个相当简单的方法：我们使用一个渗透率，它在远离中心流线的地方迅速衰减，直到达到一个背景值0.001。这是为了模仿流体在砂岩中的行为：在大部分领域中，砂岩是均匀的，虽然对流体有渗透性，但不是过分的渗透；在另一块石头上，石头沿着一条线裂开了，或者说断层了，流体沿着这条大裂缝更容易流动。下面是我们如何实现这样的东西。</p>

<p>很明显，流体基本上只沿着中线流动，而不是其他地方。</p>
<p>另一种可能性是使用一个随机的渗透率场。实现这一点的一个简单方法是在领域周围分散一些中心，然后使用一个渗透率场，这个渗透率场是这些中心的（负）指数之和。然后，流动将试图从一个高渗透率的中心跳到下一个中心。这是描述随机介质的一种完全不科学的尝试，但实现这种行为的一种可能性是这样的。</p>
