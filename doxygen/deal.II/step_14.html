<p><a class="anchor" id="Themaths"></a></p><h3>The maths</h3>
<p>The Heidelberg group of Professor Rolf Rannacher, to which the three initial authors of the deal.II library belonged during their PhD time and partly also afterwards, has been involved with adaptivity and error estimation for finite element discretizations since the mid-1990ies. The main achievement is the development of error estimates for arbitrary functionals of the solution, and of optimal mesh refinement for its computation.</p>
<p>We will not discuss the derivation of these concepts in too great detail, but will implement the main ideas in the present example program. For a thorough introduction into the general idea, we refer to the seminal work of Becker and Rannacher <b>[BR95]</b>, <b>[BR96r]</b>, and the overview article of the same authors in Acta Numerica <b>[BR01]</b>; the first introduces the concept of error estimation and adaptivity for general functional output for the Laplace equation, while the second gives many examples of applications of these concepts to a large number of other, more complicated equations. For applications to individual types of equations, see also the publications by Becker <b>[Bec95]</b>, <b>[Bec98]</b>, Kanschat <b>[Kan96]</b>, <b>[FK97]</b>, Suttmeier <b>[Sut96]</b>, <b>[RS97]</b>, <b>[RS98c]</b>, <b>[RS99]</b>, Bangerth <b>[BR99b]</b>, <b>[Ban00w]</b>, <b>[BR01a]</b>, <b>[Ban02]</b>, and Hartmann <b>[Har02]</b>, <b>[HH01]</b>, <b>[HH01b]</b>. All of these works, from the original introduction by Becker and Rannacher to individual contributions to particular equations, have later been summarized in a book by Bangerth and Rannacher that covers all of these topics, see <b>[BR03]</b>.</p>
<p>The basic idea is the following: in applications, one is not usually interested in the solution per se, but rather in certain aspects of it. For example, in simulations of flow problems, one may want to know the lift or drag of a body immersed in the fluid; it is this quantity that we want to know to best accuracy, and whether the rest of the solution of the describing equations is well resolved is not of primary interest. Likewise, in elasticity one might want to know about values of the stress at certain points to guess whether maximal load values of joints are safe, for example. Or, in radiative transfer problems, mean flux intensities are of interest.</p>
<p>In all the cases just listed, it is the evaluation of a functional \(J(u)\) of the solution which we are interested in, rather than the values of \(u\) everywhere. Since the exact solution \(u\) is not available, but only its numerical approximation \(u_h\), it is sensible to ask whether the computed value \(J(u_h)\) is within certain limits of the exact value \(J(u)\), i.e. we want to bound the error with respect to this functional, \(J(u)-J(u_h)\).</p>
<p>For simplicity of exposition, we henceforth assume that both the quantity of interest \(J\), as well as the equation are linear, and we will in particular show the derivation for the Laplace equation with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, although the concept is much more general. For this general case, we refer to the references listed above. The goal is to obtain bounds on the error, \(J(e)=J(u)-J(u_h)\). For this, let us denote by \(z\) the solution of a dual problem, defined as follows: </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[ a(\varphi,z) = J(\varphi) \qquad \forall \varphi, \]
</p>
<p> where \(a(\cdot,\cdot)\) is the bilinear form associated with the differential equation, and the test functions are chosen from the corresponding solution space. Then, taking as special test function \(\varphi=e\) the error, we have that </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[ J(e) = a(e,z) \]
</p>
<p> and we can, by Galerkin orthogonality, rewrite this as </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[ J(e) = a(e,z-\varphi_h) \]
</p>
<p> where \(\varphi_h\) can be chosen from the discrete test space in whatever way we find convenient.</p>
<p>Concretely, for Laplace's equation, the error identity reads </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[ J(e) = (\nabla e, \nabla(z-\varphi_h)). \]
</p>
<p> Because we want to use this formula not only to compute error, but also to refine the mesh, we need to rewrite the expression above as a sum over cells where each cell's contribution can then be used as an error indicator for this cell. Thus, we split the scalar products into terms for each cell, and integrate by parts on each of them: </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} J(e) &amp;=&amp; \sum_K (\nabla (u-u_h), \nabla (z-\varphi_h))_K \\ &amp;=&amp; \sum_K (-\Delta (u-u_h), z-\varphi_h)_K + (\partial_n (u-u_h), z-z_h)_{\partial K}. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> Next we use that \(-\Delta u=f\), and that for solutions of the Laplace equation, the solution is smooth enough that \(\partial_n u\) is continuous almost everywhere &ndash; so the terms involving \(\partial_n u\) on one cell cancels with that on its neighbor, where the normal vector has the opposite sign. (The same is not true for \(\partial_n u_h\), though.) At the boundary of the domain, where there is no neighbor cell with which this term could cancel, the weight \(z-\varphi_h\) can be chosen as zero, and the whole term disappears.</p>
<p>Thus, we have </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} J(e) &amp;=&amp; \sum_K (f+\Delta u_h, z-\varphi_h)_K - (\partial_n u_h, z-\varphi_h)_{\partial K\backslash \partial\Omega}. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> In a final step, note that when taking the normal derivative of \(u_h\), we mean the value of this quantity as taken from this side of the cell (for the usual Lagrange elements, derivatives are not continuous across edges). We then rewrite the above formula by exchanging half of the edge integral of cell \(K\) with the neighbor cell \(K&#39;\), to obtain </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} J(e) &amp;=&amp; \sum_K (f+\Delta u_h, z-\varphi_h)_K - \frac 12 (\partial_n u_h|_K + \partial_{n&#39;} u_h|_{K&#39;}, z-\varphi_h)_{\partial K\backslash \partial\Omega}. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> Using that for the normal vectors on adjacent cells we have \(n&#39;=-n\), we define the jump of the normal derivative by </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[ [\partial_n u_h] \dealcoloneq \partial_n u_h|_K + \partial_{n&#39;} u_h|_{K&#39;} = \partial_n u_h|_K - \partial_n u_h|_{K&#39;}, \]
</p>
<p> and get the final form after setting the discrete function \(\varphi_h\), which is by now still arbitrary, to the point interpolation of the dual solution, \(\varphi_h=I_h z\): </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} J(e) &amp;=&amp; \sum_K (f+\Delta u_h, z-I_h z)_K - \frac 12 ([\partial_n u_h], z-I_h z)_{\partial K\backslash \partial\Omega}. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p>With this, we have obtained an exact representation of the error of the finite element discretization with respect to arbitrary (linear) functionals \(J(\cdot)\). Its structure is a weighted form of a residual estimator, as both \(f+\Delta u_h\) and \([\partial_n u_h]\) are cell and edge residuals that vanish on the exact solution, and \(z-I_h z\) are weights indicating how important the residuals on a certain cell is for the evaluation of the given functional. Furthermore, it is a cell-wise quantity, so we can use it as a mesh refinement criterion. The question, is: how to evaluate it? After all, the evaluation requires knowledge of the dual solution \(z\), which carries the information about the quantity we want to know to best accuracy.</p>
<p>In some, very special cases, this dual solution is known. For example, if the functional \(J(\cdot)\) is the point evaluation, \(J(\varphi)=\varphi(x_0)\), then the dual solution has to satisfy </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[ -\Delta z = \delta(x-x_0), \]
</p>
<p> with the Dirac delta function on the right hand side, and the dual solution is the Green's function with respect to the point \(x_0\). For simple geometries, this function is analytically known, and we could insert it into the error representation formula.</p>
<p>However, we do not want to restrict ourselves to such special cases. Rather, we will compute the dual solution numerically, and approximate \(z\) by some numerically obtained \(\tilde z\). We note that it is not sufficient to compute this approximation \(\tilde z\) using the same method as used for the primal solution \(u_h\), since then \(\tilde z-I_h \tilde z=0\), and the overall error estimate would be zero. Rather, the approximation \(\tilde z\) has to be from a larger space than the primal finite element space. There are various ways to obtain such an approximation (see the cited literature), and we will choose to compute it with a higher order finite element space. While this is certainly not the most efficient way, it is simple since we already have all we need to do that in place, and it also allows for simple experimenting. For more efficient methods, again refer to the given literature, in particular <b>[BR95]</b>, <b>[BR03]</b>.</p>
<p>With this, we end the discussion of the mathematical side of this program and turn to the actual implementation.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>There are two steps above that do not seem necessary if all you care about is computing the error: namely, (i) the subtraction of \(\phi_h\) from \(z\), and (ii) splitting the integral into a sum of cells and integrating by parts on each. Indeed, neither of these two steps change \(J(e)\) at all, as we only ever consider identities above until the substitution of \(z\) by \(\tilde z\). In other words, if you care only about <em>estimating the global error</em> \(J(e)\), then these steps are not necessary. On the other hand, if you want to use the error estimate also as a refinement criterion for each cell of the mesh, then it is necessary to (i) break the estimate into a sum of cells, and (ii) massage the formulas in such a way that each cell's contributions have something to do with the local error. (While the contortions above do not change the value of the <em>sum</em> \(J(e)\), they change the values we compute for each cell \(K\).) To this end, we want to write everything in the form "residual times dual weight" where a "residual" is something that goes to zero as the approximation becomes \(u_h\) better and better. For example, the quantity \(\partial_n u_h\) is not a residual, since it simply converges to the (normal component of) the gradient of the exact solution. On the other hand, \([\partial_n u_h]\) is a residual because it converges to \([\partial_n u]=0\). All of the steps we have taken above in developing the final form of \(J(e)\) have indeed had the goal of bringing the final formula into a form where each term converges to zero as the discrete solution \(u_h\) converges to \(u\). This then allows considering each cell's contribution as an "error indicator" that also converges to zero &ndash; as it should as the mesh is refined.</dd></dl>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Thesoftware"></a></p><h3>The software</h3>
<p>The <a class="el" href="step_14.html">step-14</a> example program builds heavily on the techniques already used in the <a class="el" href="step_13.html">step-13</a> program. Its implementation of the dual weighted residual error estimator explained above is done by deriving a second class, properly called <code>DualSolver</code>, from the <code>Solver</code> base class, and having a class (<code>WeightedResidual</code>) that joins the two again and controls the solution of the primal and dual problem, and then uses both to compute the error indicator for mesh refinement.</p>
<p>The program continues the modular concept of the previous example, by implementing the dual functional, describing quantity of interest, by an abstract base class, and providing two different functionals which implement this interface. Adding a different quantity of interest is thus simple.</p>
<p>One of the more fundamental differences is the handling of data. A common case is that you develop a program that solves a certain equation, and test it with different right hand sides, different domains, different coefficients and boundary values, etc. Usually, these have to match, so that exact solutions are known, or that their combination makes sense at all.</p>
<p>We demonstrate a way how this can be achieved in a simple, yet very flexible way. We will put everything that belongs to a certain setup into one class, and provide a little C++ mortar around it, so that entire setups (domains, coefficients, right hand sides, etc.) can be exchanged by only changing something in <em>one</em> place.</p>
<p>Going this way a little further, we have also centralized all the other parameters that describe how the program is to work in one place, such as the order of the finite element, the maximal number of degrees of freedom, the evaluation objects that shall be executed on the computed solutions, and so on. This allows for simpler configuration of the program, and we will show in a later program how to use a library class that can handle setting these parameters by reading an input file. The general aim is to reduce the places within a program where one may have to look when wanting to change some parameter, as it has turned out in practice that one forgets where they are as programs grow. Furthermore, putting all options describing what the program does in a certain run into a file (that can be stored with the results) helps repeatability of results more than if the various flags were set somewhere in the program, where their exact values are forgotten after the next change to this place.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the program has become rather long. While this admittedly reduces its usefulness as an example program, we think that it is a very good starting point for development of a program for other kinds of problems, involving different equations than the Laplace equation treated here. Furthermore, it shows everything that we can show you about our way of a posteriori error estimation, and its structure should make it simple for you to adjust this method to other problems, other functionals, other geometries, coefficients, etc.</p>
<p>The author believes that the present program is his masterpiece among the example programs, regarding the mathematical complexity, as well as the simplicity to add extensions. If you use this program as a basis for your own programs, we would kindly like to ask you to state this fact and the name of the author of the example program, Wolfgang Bangerth, in publications that arise from that, of your program consists in a considerable part of the example program.</p>

<p>Besides the class implementing the evaluation of the solution at one point, we here provide one which evaluates the gradient at a grid point. Since in general the gradient of a finite element function is not continuous at a vertex, we have to be a little bit more careful here. What we do is to loop over all cells, even if we have found the point already on one cell, and use the mean value of the gradient at the vertex taken from all adjacent cells.</p>
<p>Given the interface of the <code>PointValueEvaluation</code> class, the declaration of this class provides little surprise, and neither does the constructor:</p>

<p>Rather, we have to evaluate the finite element field on this cell, and at a certain point. As you know, evaluating finite element fields at certain points is done through the <code><a class="el" href="classFEValues.html">FEValues</a></code> class, so we use that. The question is: the <code><a class="el" href="classFEValues.html">FEValues</a></code> object needs to be a given a quadrature formula and can then compute the values of finite element quantities at the quadrature points. Here, we don't want to do quadrature, we simply want to specify some points!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the same way is chosen: use a special quadrature rule with points at the vertices, since these are what we are interested in. The appropriate rule is the trapezoidal rule, so that is the reason why we used that one above.</p>
<p>Thus: initialize the <code><a class="el" href="classFEValues.html">FEValues</a></code> object on this cell,</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">fe_values.reinit(cell);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>and extract the gradients of the solution vector at the vertices:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">fe_values.<a class="code" href="classFEValuesBase.html#ad1f4e0deb5d982e8172d82141c634a67">get_function_gradients</a>(solution, solution_gradients);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Now we have the gradients at all vertices, so pick out that one which belongs to the evaluation point (note that the order of vertices is not necessarily the same as that of the quadrature points):</p>

<div class="fragment"><div class="line">point_derivative += solution_gradients[q_point][0];</div><div class="line">++evaluation_point_hits;</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Finally break out of the innermost loop iterating over the vertices of the present cell, since if we have found the evaluation point at one vertex it cannot be at a following vertex as well:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">  <span class="keywordflow">break</span>;</div><div class="line">}</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Now we have looped over all cells and vertices, so check whether the point was found:</p>

<p>Since this program has a more difficult structure (it computed a dual solution in addition to a primal one), writing out the solution is no more done by an evaluation object since we want to write both solutions at once into one file, and that requires some more information than available to the evaluation classes.</p>
<p>However, we also want to look at the grids generated. This again can be done with one such class. Its structure is analog to the <code>SolutionOutput</code> class of the previous example program, so we do not discuss it here in more detail. Furthermore, everything that is used here has already been used in previous example programs.</p>

<p>This class is almost unchanged, with the exception that it declares two more functions: <code>output_solution</code> will be used to generate output files from the actual solutions computed by derived classes, and the <code>set_refinement_cycle</code> function by which the testing framework sets the number of the refinement cycle to a local variable in this class; this number is later used to generate filenames for the solution output.</p>

First, the constructor initializes all data elements to their correct sizes, and sets up a number of additional data structures, such as constraints due to hanging nodes. Since setting up the hanging nodes and finding out about the nonzero elements of the matrix is independent, we do that in parallel (if the library was configured to use concurrency, at least; otherwise, the actions are performed sequentially). Note that we start only one thread, and do the second action in the main thread. Since only one thread is generated, we don't use the <code><a class="el" href="classThreads_1_1TaskGroup.html">Threads::TaskGroup</a></code> class here, but rather use the one created task object directly to wait for this particular task's exit. The approach is generally the same as the one we have used in <code>Solver::assemble_linear_system()</code> above.</p>
<p>Note that taking the address of the <code><a class="el" href="group__constraints.html#ga3b4ea7dfd313e388d868c4e4aa685799">DoFTools::make_hanging_node_constraints</a></code> function is a little tricky, since there are actually three functions of this name, one for each supported space dimension. Taking addresses of overloaded functions is somewhat complicated in C++, since the address-of operator <code>&amp;</code> in that case returns a set of values (the addresses of all functions with that name), and selecting the right one is then the next step. If the context dictates which one to take (for example by assigning to a function pointer of known type), then the compiler can do that by itself, but if this set of pointers shall be given as the argument to a function that takes a template, the compiler could choose all without having a preference for one. We therefore have to make it clear to the compiler which one we would like to have; for this, we could use a cast, but for more clarity, we assign it to a temporary <code>mhnc_p</code> (short for <code>pointer to make_hanging_node_constraints</code>) with the right type, and using this pointer instead.</p>

<p>This class is a variant of the previous one, in that it allows to weight the refinement indicators we get from the library's Kelly indicator by some function. We include this class since the goal of this example program is to demonstrate automatic refinement criteria even for complex output quantities such as point values or stresses. If we did not solve a dual problem and compute the weights thereof, we would probably be tempted to give a hand-crafted weighting to the indicators to account for the fact that we are going to evaluate these quantities. This class accepts such a weighting function as argument to its constructor:</p>

<p>In this example program, we work with the same data sets as in the previous one, but as it may so happen that someone wants to run the program with different boundary values and right hand side functions, or on a different grid, we show a simple technique to do exactly that. For more clarity, we furthermore pack everything that has to do with equation data into a namespace of its own.</p>
<p>The underlying assumption is that this is a research program, and that there we often have a number of test cases that consist of a domain, a right hand side, boundary values, possibly a specified coefficient, and a number of other parameters. They often vary all at the same time when shifting from one example to another. To make handling such sets of problem description parameters simple is the goal of the following.</p>
<p>Basically, the idea is this: let us have a structure for each set of data, in which we pack everything that describes a test case: here, these are two subclasses, one called <code>BoundaryValues</code> for the boundary values of the exact solution, and one called <code>RightHandSide</code>, and then a way to generate the coarse grid. Since the solution of the previous example program looked like curved ridges, we use this name here for the enclosing class. Note that the names of the two inner classes have to be the same for all enclosing test case classes, and also that we have attached the dimension template argument to the enclosing class rather than to the inner ones, to make further processing simpler. (From a language viewpoint, a namespace would be better to encapsulate these inner classes, rather than a structure. However, namespaces cannot be given as template arguments, so we use a structure to allow a second object to select from within its given argument. The enclosing structure, of course, has no member variables apart from the classes it declares, and a static function to generate the coarse mesh; it will in general never be instantiated.)</p>
<p>The idea is then the following (this is the right time to also take a brief look at the code below): we can generate objects for boundary values and right hand side by simply giving the name of the outer class as a template argument to a class which we call here <code>Data::SetUp</code>, and it then creates objects for the inner classes. In this case, to get all that characterizes the curved ridge solution, we would simply generate an instance of <code>Data::SetUp&lt;Data::CurvedRidge&gt;</code>, and everything we need to know about the solution would be static member variables and functions of that object.</p>
<p>This approach might seem like overkill in this case, but will become very handy once a certain set up is not only characterized by Dirichlet boundary values and a right hand side function, but in addition by material properties, Neumann values, different boundary descriptors, etc. In that case, the <code>SetUp</code> class might consist of a dozen or more objects, and each descriptor class (like the <code>CurvedRidges</code> class below) would have to provide them. Then, you will be happy to be able to change from one set of data to another by only changing the template argument to the <code>SetUp</code> class at one place, rather than at many.</p>
<p>With this framework for different test cases, we are almost finished, but one thing remains: by now we can select statically, by changing one template argument, which data set to choose. In order to be able to do that dynamically, i.e. at run time, we need a base class. This we provide in the obvious way, see below, with virtual abstract functions. It forces us to introduce a second template parameter <code>dim</code> which we need for the base class (which could be avoided using some template magic, but we omit that), but that's all.</p>
<p>Adding new testcases is now simple, you don't have to touch the framework classes, only a structure like the <code>CurvedRidges</code> one is needed.</p>

<p>Of course, the example has an extension to 3d, but since this function cannot be written in a dimension independent way we choose not to implement this here, but rather only specialize the template for dim=2.

Here, they are 24 (5 times 5, with the middle one omitted). It is probably best to draw a sketch here.</p>

<p>As you have now read through this framework, you may be wondering why we have not chosen to implement the classes implementing a certain setup (like the <code>CurvedRidges</code> class) directly as classes derived from <code>Data::SetUpBase</code>. Indeed, we could have done very well so. The only reason is that then we would have to have member variables for the solution and right hand side classes in the <code>CurvedRidges</code> class, as well as member functions overloading the abstract functions of the base class giving access to these member variables. The <code>SetUp</code> class has the sole reason to relieve us from the need to reiterate these member variables and functions that would be necessary in all such classes. In some way, the template mechanism here only provides a way to have default implementations for a number of functions that depend on external quantities and can thus not be provided using normal virtual functions, at least not without the help of templates.</p>
<p>However, there might be good reasons to actually implement classes derived from <code>Data::SetUpBase</code>, for example if the solution or right hand side classes require constructors that take arguments, which the <code>Data::SetUpBase</code> class cannot provide. In that case, subclassing is a worthwhile strategy. Other possibilities for special cases are to derive from <code>Data::SetUp&lt;SomeSetUp&gt;</code> where <code>SomeSetUp</code> denotes a class, or even to explicitly specialize <code>Data::SetUp&lt;SomeSetUp&gt;</code>. The latter allows to transparently use the way the <code>SetUp</code> class is used for other set-ups, but with special actions taken for special arguments.</p>
<p>A final observation favoring the approach taken here is the following: we have found numerous times that when starting a project, the number of parameters (usually boundary values, right hand side, coarse grid, just as here) was small, and the number of test cases was small as well. One then starts out by handcoding them into a number of <code>switch</code> statements. Over time, projects grow, and so does the number of test cases. The number of <code>switch</code> statements grows with that, and their length as well, and one starts to find ways to consider impossible examples where domains, boundary values, and right hand sides do not fit together any more, and starts losing the overview over the whole structure. Encapsulating everything belonging to a certain test case into a structure of its own has proven worthwhile for this, as it keeps everything that belongs to one test case in one place. Furthermore, it allows to put these things all in one or more files that are only devoted to test cases and their data, without having to bring their actual implementation into contact with the rest of the program.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Dualfunctionals"></a> </p><h3>Dual functionals</h3>
<p>As with the other components of the program, we put everything we need to describe dual functionals into a namespace of its own, and define an abstract base class that provides the interface the class solving the dual problem needs for its work.</p>
<p>We will then implement two such classes, for the evaluation of a point value and of the derivative of the solution at that point. For these functionals we already have the corresponding evaluation objects, so they are complementary.</p>

<p>First start with the base class for dual functionals. Since for linear problems the characteristics of the dual problem play a role only in the right hand side, we only need to provide for a function that assembles the right hand side for a given discretization:</p>

<p>As a first application, we consider the functional corresponding to the evaluation of the solution's value at a given point which again we assume to be a vertex. Apart from the constructor that takes and stores the evaluation point, this class consists only of the function that implements assembling the right hand side.</p>

Here, J is the evaluation at the point x0, i.e. J(phi_i)=phi_i(x0).</p>
<p>Now, we have assumed that the evaluation point is a vertex. Thus, for the usual finite elements we might be using in this program, we can take for granted that at such a point exactly one shape function is nonzero, and in particular has the value one. Thus, we set the right hand side vector to all-zeros, then seek for the shape function associated with that point and set the corresponding value of the right hand side vector to one:</p>

<p>We could, as in the implementation of the respective evaluation object take the average of the gradients of each shape function phi_i at this evaluation point. However, we take a slightly different approach: we simply take the average over all cells that surround this point. The question which cells <code>surrounds</code> the evaluation point is made dependent on the mesh width by including those cells for which the distance of the cell's midpoint to the evaluation point is less than the cell's diameter.</p>
<p>Taking the average of the gradient over the area/volume of these cells leads to a dual solution which is very close to the one which would result from the point evaluation of the gradient. It is simple to justify theoretically that this does not change the method significantly.</p>

<p>In the same way as the <code>PrimalSolver</code> class above, we now implement a <code>DualSolver</code>. It has all the same features, the only difference is that it does not take a function object denoting a right hand side object, but now takes a <code>DualFunctionalBase</code> object that will assemble the right hand side vector of the dual problem. The rest of the class is rather trivial.</p>
<p>Since both primal and dual solver will use the same triangulation, but different discretizations, it now becomes clear why we have made the <code>Base</code> class a virtual one: since the final class will be derived from both <code>PrimalSolver</code> as well as <code>DualSolver</code>, it would have two <code>Base</code> instances, would we not have marked the inheritance as virtual. Since in many applications the base class would store much more information than just the triangulation which needs to be shared between primal and dual solvers, we do not usually want to use two such base classes.</p>

<p>Here finally comes the main class of this program, the one that implements the dual weighted residual error estimator. It joins the primal and dual solver classes to use them for the computation of primal and dual solutions, and implements the error representation formula for use as error estimate and mesh refinement.</p>
<p>The first few of the functions of this class are mostly overriders of the respective functions of the base class:</p>

These two functions will be called in parallel by the <code>solve_problem</code> function of this class.</p>

<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">using</span> active_cell_iterator =</div><div class="line">  <span class="keyword">typename</span> <a class="code" href="classDoFHandler.html">DoFHandler&lt;dim&gt;::active_cell_iterator</a>;</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Next, declare a data type that we will us to store the contribution of faces to the error estimator. The idea is that we can compute the face terms from each of the two cells to this face, as they are the same when viewed from both sides. What we will do is to compute them only once, based on some rules explained below which of the two adjacent cells will be in charge to do so. We then store the contribution of each face in a map mapping faces to their values, and only collect the contributions for each cell by looping over the cells a second time and grabbing the values from the map.</p>
<p>The data type of this map is declared here:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">using</span> FaceIntegrals =</div><div class="line">  <span class="keyword">typename</span> std::map&lt;typename DoFHandler&lt;dim&gt;::face_iterator, <span class="keywordtype">double</span>&gt;;</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>In the computation of the error estimates on cells and faces, we need a number of helper objects, such as <code><a class="el" href="classFEValues.html">FEValues</a></code> and <code><a class="el" href="classFEFaceValues.html">FEFaceValues</a></code> functions, but also temporary objects storing the values and gradients of primal and dual solutions, for example. These fields are needed in the three functions that do the integration on cells, and regular and irregular faces, respectively.</p>
<p>There are three reasonable ways to provide these fields: first, as local variables in the function that needs them; second, as member variables of this class; third, as arguments passed to that function.</p>
<p>These three alternatives all have drawbacks: the third that their number is not negligible and would make calling these functions a lengthy enterprise. The second has the drawback that it disallows parallelization, since the threads that will compute the error estimate have to have their own copies of these variables each, so member variables of the enclosing class will not work. The first approach, although straightforward, has a subtle but important drawback: we will call these functions over and over again, many thousands of times maybe; it now turns out that allocating vectors and other objects that need memory from the heap is an expensive business in terms of run-time, since memory allocation is expensive when several threads are involved. It is thus significantly better to allocate the memory only once, and recycle the objects as often as possible.</p>
<p>What to do? Our answer is to use a variant of the third strategy. In fact, this is exactly what the <a class="el" href="namespaceWorkStream.html">WorkStream</a> concept is supposed to do (we have already introduced it above, but see also <a class="el" href="group__threads.html">Parallel computing with multiple processors accessing</a>). To avoid that we have to give these functions a dozen or so arguments, we pack all these variables into two structures, one which is used for the computations on cells, the other doing them on the faces. Both are then joined into the WeightedResidualScratchData class that will serve as the "scratch data" class of the <a class="el" href="namespaceWorkStream.html">WorkStream</a> concept:</p>

<p>As for the actual computation of error estimates, let's start with the function that drives all this, i.e. calls those functions that actually do the work, and finally collects the results.</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">template</span> &lt;<span class="keywordtype">int</span> dim&gt;</div><div class="line"><span class="keywordtype">void</span></div><div class="line">WeightedResidual&lt;dim&gt;::estimate_error(<a class="code" href="classVector.html">Vector&lt;float&gt;</a> &amp;error_indicators)<span class="keyword"> const</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword"></span>{</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>The first task in computing the error is to set up vectors that denote the primal solution, and the weights (z-z_h)=(z-I_hz), both in the finite element space for which we have computed the dual solution. For this, we have to interpolate the primal solution to the dual finite element space, and to subtract the interpolation of the computed dual solution to the primal finite element space. Fortunately, the library provides functions for the interpolation into larger or smaller finite element spaces, so this is mostly obvious.</p>
<p>First, let's do that for the primal solution: it is cell-wise interpolated into the finite element space in which we have solved the dual problem: But, again as in the <code>WeightedResidual::output_solution</code> function we first need to create an <a class="el" href="classAffineConstraints.html">AffineConstraints</a> object including the hanging node constraints, but this time of the dual finite element space.</p>

We leave the optimization of the program in this respect as an exercise.</p>
<p>Having computed the dual weights we now proceed with computing the cell and face residuals of the primal solution. First we set up a map between face iterators and their jump term contributions of faces to the error estimator. The reason is that we compute the jump terms only once, from one side of the face, and want to collect them only afterwards when looping over all cells a second time.</p>
<p>We initialize this map already with a value of -1e20 for all faces, since this value will stand out in the results if something should go wrong and we fail to compute the value for a face for some reason. Secondly, this initialization already makes the std::map object allocate all objects it may possibly need. This is important since we will write into this structure from parallel threads, and doing so would not be thread-safe if the map needed to allocate memory and thereby reshape its data structures. In other words, the initial initialization relieves us from the necessity to synchronize the threads through a mutex each time they write to (and modify the structure of) this map.</p>

<p>You will have noted that this program is built up of a number of small parts (evaluation functions, solver classes implementing various refinement methods, different dual functionals, different problem and data descriptions), which makes the program relatively simple to extend, but also allows to solve a large number of different problems by replacing one part by another. We reflect this flexibility by declaring a structure in the following framework class that holds a number of parameters that may be set to test various combinations of the parts of this program, and which can be used to test it at various problems and discretizations in a simple way.</p>

<p>Apparently, the region at the bottom left is so unimportant for the point value evaluation at the top right that the grid is left entirely unrefined there, even though the solution has singularities at the inner corner of that cell! Due to the symmetry in right hand side and domain, the solution should actually look like at the top right in all four corners, but the mesh refinement criterion involving the dual solution chose to refine them differently &ndash; because we said that we really only care about a single function value somewhere at the top right.</p>

<p>Note the subtle interplay between resolving the corner singularities, and resolving around the point of evaluation. It will be rather difficult to generate such a mesh by hand, as this would involve to judge quantitatively how much which of the four corner singularities should be resolved, and to set the weight compared to the vicinity of the evaluation point.</p>
<p>The program prints the point value and the estimated error in this quantity. From extrapolating it, we can guess that the exact value is somewhere close to 0.0334473, plus or minus 0.0000001 (note that we get almost 6 valid digits from only 22,000 (primal) degrees of freedom. This number cannot be obtained from the value of the functional alone, but I have used the assumption that the error estimator is mostly exact, and extrapolated the computed value plus the estimated error, to get an approximation of the true value. Computing with more degrees of freedom shows that this assumption is indeed valid.</p>
<p>From the computed results, we can generate two graphs: one that shows the convergence of the error \(J(u)-J(u_h)\) (taking the extrapolated value as correct) in the point value, and the value that we get by adding up computed value \(J(u_h)\) and estimated error eta (if the error estimator \(eta\) were exact, then the value \(J(u_h)+\eta\) would equal the exact point value, and the error in this quantity would always be zero; however, since the error estimator is only a - good - approximation to the true error, we can by this only reduce the size of the error). In this graph, we also indicate the complexity \({\cal O}(1/N)\) to show that mesh refinement acts optimal in this case. The second chart compares true and estimated error, and shows that the two are actually very close to each other, even for such a complicated quantity as the point value:</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="Comparingrefinementcriteria"></a></p><h3>Comparing refinement criteria</h3>
<p>Since we have accepted quite some effort when using the mesh refinement driven by the dual weighted error estimator (for solving the dual problem, and for evaluating the error representation), it is worth while asking whether that effort was successful. To this end, we first compare the achieved error levels for different mesh refinement criteria. To generate this data, simply change the value of the mesh refinement criterion variable in the main program. The results are thus (for the weight in the Kelly indicator, we have chosen the function \(1/(r^2+0.1^2)\), where \(r\) is the distance to the evaluation point; it can be shown that this is the optimal weight if we neglect the effects of boundaries):</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="https://www.dealii.org/images/steps/developer/step-14.point-value.error-comparison.png"/>
</div>
<p>Checking these numbers, we see that for global refinement, the error is proportional to \(O(1/(sqrt(N) log(N)))\), and for the dual estimator \(O(1/N)\). Generally speaking, we see that the dual weighted error estimator is better than the other refinement indicators, at least when compared with those that have a similarly regular behavior. The Kelly indicator produces smaller errors, but jumps about the picture rather irregularly, with the error also changing signs sometimes. Therefore, its behavior does not allow to extrapolate the results to larger values of N. Furthermore, if we trust the error estimates of the dual weighted error estimator, the results can be improved by adding the estimated error to the computed values. In terms of reliability, the weighted estimator is thus better than the Kelly indicator, although the latter sometimes produces smaller errors.</p>

<p>Note the asymmetry of the grids compared with those we obtained for the point evaluation. This is due to the fact that the domain and the primal solution may be symmetric about the diagonal, but the \(x\)-derivative is not, and the latter enters the refinement criterion.</p>
<p>Then, it is interesting to compare actually computed values of the quantity of interest (i.e. the x-derivative of the solution at one point) with a reference value of -0.0528223... plus or minus 0.0000005. We get this reference value by computing on finer grid after some more mesh refinements, with approximately 130,000 cells. Recall that if the error is \(O(1/N)\) in the optimal case, then taking a mesh with ten times more cells gives us one additional digit in the result.</p>
<p>In the left part of the following chart, you again see the convergence of the error towards this extrapolated value, while on the right you see a comparison of true and estimated error:</p>

<p>After an initial phase where the true error changes its sign, the estimated error matches it quite well, again. Also note the dramatic improvement in the error when using the estimated error to correct the computed value of \(J(u_h)\).</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="step13revisited"></a></p><h3>step-13 revisited</h3>
<p>If instead of the <code>Exercise_2_3</code> data set, we choose <code>CurvedRidges</code> in the main function, and choose \((0.5,0.5)\) as the evaluation point, then we can redo the computations of the previous example program, to compare whether the results obtained with the help of the dual weighted error estimator are better than those we had previously.</p>
<p>First, the meshes after 9 adaptive refinement cycles obtained with the point evaluation and derivative evaluation refinement criteria, respectively, look like this:</p>
<table width="80%" align="center">
<tr>
<td><div class="image">

</div>
  </td></tr>
</table>
<p>The features of the solution can still be seen in the mesh, but since the solution is smooth, the singularities of the dual solution entirely dominate the mesh refinement criterion, and lead to strongly concentrated meshes. The solution after the seventh refinement step looks like the following:</p>
<table width="40%" align="center">

  </td></tr>
</table>
<p>Obviously, the solution is worse at some places, but the mesh refinement process should have taken care that these places are not important for computing the point value.</p>
<p>The next point is to compare the new (duality based) mesh refinement criterion with the old ones. These are the results:</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="https://www.dealii.org/images/steps/developer/step-14.step-13.error-comparison.png"/>
</div>
<p>The results are, well, somewhat mixed. First, the Kelly indicator disqualifies itself by its unsteady behavior, changing the sign of the error several times, and with increasing errors under mesh refinement. The dual weighted error estimator has a monotone decrease in the error, and is better than the weighted Kelly and global refinement, but the margin is not as large as expected. This is, here, due to the fact the global refinement can exploit the regular structure of the meshes around the point of evaluation, which leads to a better order of convergence for the point error. However, if we had a mesh that is not locally rectangular, for example because we had to approximate curved boundaries, or if the coefficients were not constant, then this advantage of globally refinement meshes would vanish, while the good performance of the duality based estimator would remain.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Conclusionsandoutlook"></a></p><h3>Conclusions and outlook</h3>
<p>The results here are not too clearly indicating the superiority of the dual weighted error estimation approach for mesh refinement over other mesh refinement criteria, such as the Kelly indicator. This is due to the relative simplicity of the shown applications. If you are not convinced yet that this approach is indeed superior, you are invited to browse through the literature indicated in the introduction, where plenty of examples are provided where the dual weighted approach can reduce the necessary numerical work by orders of magnitude, making this the only way to compute certain quantities to reasonable accuracies at all.</p>
<p>Besides the objections you may raise against its use as a mesh refinement criterion, consider that accurate knowledge of the error in the quantity one might want to compute is of great use, since we can stop computations when we are satisfied with the accuracy. Using more traditional approaches, it is very difficult to get accurate estimates for arbitrary quantities, except for, maybe, the error in the energy norm, and we will then have no guarantee that the result we computed satisfies any requirements on its accuracy. Also, as was shown for the evaluation of point values and derivatives, the error estimate can be used to extrapolate the results, yielding much higher accuracy in the quantity we want to know.</p>
<p>Leaving these mathematical considerations, we tried to write the program in a modular way, such that implementing another test case, or another evaluation and dual functional is simple. You are encouraged to take the program as a basis for your own experiments, and to play a little.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="Themaths"></a></p><h3>The maths</h3>
<p>The Heidelberg group of Professor Rolf Rannacher, to which the three initialauthors of the deal.II library belonged during their PhD time and partly alsoafterwards, has been involved with adaptivity and error estimation for finiteelement discretizations since the mid-1990ies. The main achievement is thedevelopment of error estimates for arbitrary functionals of the solution, andof optimal mesh refinement for its computation. We will not discuss the derivation of these concepts in too great detail, butwill implement the main ideas in the present example program. For a thoroughintroduction into the general idea, we refer to the seminal work of Becker andRannacher <b>[BR95]</b> , <b>[BR96r]</b> , and the overview article of the same authors inActa Numerica <b>[BR01]</b> ; the first introduces the concept of errorestimation and adaptivity for general functional output for the Laplaceequation, while the second gives many examples of applications of theseconcepts to a large number of other, more complicated equations. Forapplications to individual types of equations, see also the publications byBecker <b>[Bec95]</b> , <b>[Bec98]</b> , Kanschat <b>[Kan96]</b> , <b>[FK97]</b> , Suttmeier <b>[Sut96]</b> , <b>[RS97]</b> , <b>[RS98c]</b> , <b>[RS99]</b> , Bangerth <b>[BR99b]</b> , <b>[Ban00w]</b> , <b>[BR01a]</b> , <b>[Ban02]</b> , and Hartmann <b>[Har02]</b> , <b>[HH01]</b> , <b>[HH01b]</b> . All of these works, from the original introduction by Becker andRannacher to individual contributions to particular equations, have later beensummarized in a book by Bangerth and Rannacher that covers all of these topics,see <b>[BR03]</b> .</p>
<p>The basic idea is the following: in applications, one is not usuallyinterested in the solution per se, but rather in certain aspects of it. Forexample, in simulations of flow problems, one may want to know the lift ordrag of a body immersed in the fluid; it is this quantity that we want to knowto best accuracy, and whether the rest of the solution of the describingequations is well resolved is not of primary interest. Likewise, in elasticityone might want to know about values of the stress at certain points to guesswhether maximal load values of joints are safe, for example. Or, in radiativetransfer problems, mean flux intensities are of interest. In all the cases just listed, it is the evaluation of a functional \(J(u)\) ofthe solution which we are interested in, rather than the values of \(u\) everywhere. Since the exact solution \(u\) is not available, but only itsnumerical approximation \(u_h\) , it is sensible to ask whether the computedvalue \(J(u_h)\) is within certain limits of the exact value \(J(u)\) , i.e. wewant to bound the error with respect to this functional, \(J(u)-J(u_h)\) . For simplicity of exposition, we henceforth assume that both the quantity ofinterest \(J\) , as well as the equation are linear, and we will in particularshow the derivation for the Laplace equation with homogeneous Dirichletboundary conditions, although the concept is much more general. For thisgeneral case, we refer to the references listed above. The goal is to obtainbounds on the error, \(J(e)=J(u)-J(u_h)\) . For this, let us denote by \(z\) thesolution of a dual problem, defined as follows: </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[ a(\varphi,z) = J(\varphi) \qquad \forall \varphi, \]
</p>
<p> \(a(\cdot,\cdot)\) is the bilinear form associated with the differentialequation, and the test functions are chosen from the corresponding solutionspace. Then, taking as special test function \(\varphi=e\) the error, we havethat </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[ J(e) = a(e,z) \]
</p>
<p> we can, by Galerkin orthogonality, rewrite this as </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[ J(e) = a(e,z-\varphi_h) \]
</p>
<p> \(\varphi_h\) can be chosen from the discrete test space inwhatever way we find convenient. Concretely, for Laplace's equation, the error identity reads </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[ J(e) = (\nabla e, \nabla(z-\varphi_h)). \]
</p>
<p> we want to use this formula not only to compute error, butalso to refine the mesh, we need to rewrite the expression above as asum over cells where each cell's contribution can then be used as anerror indicator for this cell.Thus, we split the scalar products into terms for each cell, andintegrate by parts on each of them: </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} J(e) &amp;=&amp; \sum_K (\nabla (u-u_h), \nabla (z-\varphi_h))_K \\ &amp;=&amp; \sum_K (-\Delta (u-u_h), z-\varphi_h)_K + (\partial_n (u-u_h), z-z_h)_{\partial K}. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p> Next we use that \(-\Delta u=f\) , and that for solutions of the Laplaceequation, the solution is smooth enough that \(\partial_n u\) iscontinuous almost everywhere</p>
<ul>
<li>so the terms involving \(\partial_n u\) on onecell cancels with that on its neighbor, where the normal vector has theopposite sign. (The same is not true for \(\partial_n u_h\) , though.)At the boundary of the domain, where there is no neighbor cellwith which this term could cancel, the weight \(z-\varphi_h\) can be chosen aszero, and the whole term disappears. Thus, we have <p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} J(e) &amp;=&amp; \sum_K (f+\Delta u_h, z-\varphi_h)_K - (\partial_n u_h, z-\varphi_h)_{\partial K\backslash \partial\Omega}. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
 In a final step, note that when taking the normal derivative of \(u_h\) , we meanthe value of this quantity as taken from this side of the cell (for the usualLagrange elements, derivatives are not continuous across edges). We thenrewrite the above formula by exchanging half of the edge integral of cell \(K\) with the neighbor cell \(K&#39;\) , to obtain <p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} J(e) &amp;=&amp; \sum_K (f+\Delta u_h, z-\varphi_h)_K - \frac 12 (\partial_n u_h|_K + \partial_{n&#39;} u_h|_{K&#39;}, z-\varphi_h)_{\partial K\backslash \partial\Omega}. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
 Using that for the normal vectors on adjacent cells we have \(n&#39;=-n\) , we define the jump of thenormal derivative by <p class="formulaDsp">
\[ [\partial_n u_h] \dealcoloneq \partial_n u_h|_K + \partial_{n&#39;} u_h|_{K&#39;} = \partial_n u_h|_K - \partial_n u_h|_{K&#39;}, \]
</p>
 get the final form after setting the discrete function \(\varphi_h\) , whichis by now still arbitrary, to the point interpolation of the dual solution, \(\varphi_h=I_h z\) : <p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} J(e) &amp;=&amp; \sum_K (f+\Delta u_h, z-I_h z)_K - \frac 12 ([\partial_n u_h], z-I_h z)_{\partial K\backslash \partial\Omega}. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With this, we have obtained an exact representation of the error of the finiteelement discretization with respect to arbitrary (linear) functionals \(J(\cdot)\) . Its structure is a weighted form of a residual estimator, as both \(f+\Delta u_h\) and \([\partial_n u_h]\) are cell and edge residuals that vanishon the exact solution, and \(z-I_h z\) are weights indicating how important theresiduals on a certain cell is for the evaluation of the given functional.Furthermore, it is a cell-wise quantity, so we can use it as a mesh refinementcriterion. The question, is: how to evaluate it? After all, the evaluationrequires knowledge of the dual solution \(z\) , which carries the informationabout the quantity we want to know to best accuracy. In some, very special cases, this dual solution is known. For example, if thefunctional \(J(\cdot)\) is the point evaluation, \(J(\varphi)=\varphi(x_0)\) , thenthe dual solution has to satisfy </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[ -\Delta z = \delta(x-x_0), \]
</p>
<p> the Dirac delta function on the right hand side, and the dual solution isthe Green's function with respect to the point \(x_0\) . For simple geometries,this function is analytically known, and we could insert it into the errorrepresentation formula. However, we do not want to restrict ourselves to such special cases. Rather,we will compute the dual solution numerically, and approximate \(z\) by somenumerically obtained \(\tilde z\) . We note that it is not sufficient to computethis approximation \(\tilde z\) using the same method as used for the primalsolution \(u_h\) , since then \(\tilde z-I_h \tilde z=0\) , and the overall errorestimate would be zero. Rather, the approximation \(\tilde z\) has to be from alarger space than the primal finite element space. There are various ways toobtain such an approximation (see the cited literature), and we will choose tocompute it with a higher order finite element space. While this is certainlynot the most efficient way, it is simple since we already have all we need todo that in place, and it also allows for simple experimenting. For moreefficient methods, again refer to the given literature, in particular <b>[BR95]</b> , <b>[BR03]</b> . With this, we end the discussion of the mathematical side of this program andturn to the actual implementation.</p>
<pre class="fragment">@note   There are two steps above that do not seem necessary if all youcare about is computing the error: namely, (i) the subtraction of \form#2527   from \form#44  , and (ii) splitting the integral into a sum of cellsand integrating by parts on each. Indeed, neither of these two stepschange \form#2528   at all, as we only ever consider identities above untilthe substitution of \form#44   by \form#2525  . In other words, if you careonly about &lt;i&gt;estimating the global error&lt;/i&gt; \form#2528  , then these stepsare not necessary. On the other hand, if you want to use the errorestimate also as a refinement criterion for each cell of the mesh,then it is necessary to (i) break the estimate into a sum of cells,and (ii) massage the formulas in such a way that each cell'scontributions have something to do with the local error. (While thecontortions above do not change the value of the &lt;i&gt;sum&lt;/i&gt; \form#2528  ,they change the values we compute for each cell \form#87  .) To this end, wewant to write everything in the form "residual times dual weight"where a "residual" is something that goes to zero as the approximationbecomes \form#1156   better and better. For example, the quantity \form#2511@_fakenl   is not a residual, since it simply converges to the (normalcomponent of) the gradient of the exact solution. On the other hand, \form#2521   is a residual because it converges to \form#2529@_fakenl  . All of the steps we have taken above in developing the finalform of \form#2528   have indeed had the goal of bringing the final formulainto a form where each term converges to zero as the discrete solution \form#1156   converges to \form#302  . This then allows considering each cell'scontribution as an "error indicator" that also converges to zero

<p><a class="anchor" id="Thesoftware"></a></p><h3>The software</h3>
<p>The <a class="el" href="step_14.html">step-14</a> example program builds heavily on the techniques already used inthe <a class="el" href="step_13.html">step-13</a> program. Its implementation of the dual weighted residual errorestimator explained above is done by deriving a second class, properly called <code>DualSolver</code>, from the <code>Solver</code> base class, and having a class( <code>WeightedResidual</code> ) that joins the two again and controls the solutionof the primal and dual problem, and then uses both to compute the errorindicator for mesh refinement. The program continues the modular concept of the previous example, byimplementing the dual functional, describing quantity of interest, by anabstract base class, and providing two different functionals which implementthis interface. Adding a different quantity of interest is thus simple. One of the more fundamental differences is the handling of data. A common caseis that you develop a program that solves a certain equation, and test it withdifferent right hand sides, different domains, different coefficients andboundary values, etc. Usually, these have to match, so that exact solutionsare known, or that their combination makes sense at all. We demonstrate a way how this can be achieved in a simple, yet very flexibleway. We will put everything that belongs to a certain setup into one class,and provide a little C++ mortar around it, so that entire setups (domains,coefficients, right hand sides, etc.) can be exchanged by only changingsomething in <em> one </em> place. Going this way a little further, we have also centralized all the otherparameters that describe how the program is to work in one place, such as theorder of the finite element, the maximal number of degrees of freedom, theevaluation objects that shall be executed on the computed solutions, and soon. This allows for simpler configuration of the program, and we will show ina later program how to use a library class that can handle setting theseparameters by reading an input file. The general aim is to reduce the placeswithin a program where one may have to look when wanting to change someparameter, as it has turned out in practice that one forgets where they are asprograms grow. Furthermore, putting all options describing what the programdoes in a certain run into a file (that can be stored with the results) helpsrepeatability of results more than if the various flags were set somewhere inthe program, where their exact values are forgotten after the next change tothis place. Unfortunately, the program has become rather long. While this admittedlyreduces its usefulness as an example program, we think that it is a very goodstarting point for development of a program for other kinds of problems,involving different equations than the Laplace equation treated here.Furthermore, it shows everything that we can show you about our way of aposteriori error estimation, and its structure should make it simple for youto adjust this method to other problems, other functionals, other geometries,coefficients, etc. The author believes that the present program is his masterpiece among theexample programs, regarding the mathematical complexity, as well as thesimplicity to add extensions. If you use this program as a basis for your ownprograms, we would kindly like to ask you to state this fact and the name ofthe author of the example program, Wolfgang Bangerth, in publications thatarise from that, of your program consists in a considerable part of theexample program.</p>

<p>Besides the class implementing the evaluation of the solution at one point, we here provide one which evaluates the gradient at a grid point. Since in general the gradient of a finite element function is not continuous at a vertex, we have to be a little bit more careful here. What we do is to loop over all cells, even if we have found the point already on one cell, and use the mean value of the gradient at the vertex taken from all adjacent cells. Given the interface of the <code>PointValueEvaluation</code> class, the declaration of this class provides little surprise, and neither does the constructor:</p>

Rather, we have to evaluate the finite element field on this cell, and at a certain point. As you know, evaluating finite element fields at certain points is done through the <code><a class="el" href="classFEValues.html">FEValues</a></code> class, so we use that. The question is: the <code><a class="el" href="classFEValues.html">FEValues</a></code> object needs to be a given a quadrature formula and can then compute the values of finite element quantities at the quadrature points. Here, we don't want to do quadrature, we simply want to specify some points! Nevertheless, the same way is chosen: use a special quadrature rule with points at the vertices, since these are what we are interested in. The appropriate rule is the trapezoidal rule, so that is the reason why we used that one above. Thus: initialize the <code><a class="el" href="classFEValues.html">FEValues</a></code> object on this cell,</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">fe_values.reinit(cell);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>and extract the gradients of the solution vector at the vertices:</p>

<div class="fragment"><div class="line">point_derivative += solution_gradients[q_point][0];</div><div class="line">++evaluation_point_hits;</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Finally break out of the innermost loop iterating over the vertices of the present cell, since if we have found the evaluation point at one vertex it cannot be at a following vertex as well:</p>

<p>Since this program has a more difficult structure (it computed a dual solution in addition to a primal one), writing out the solution is no more done by an evaluation object since we want to write both solutions at once into one file, and that requires some more information than available to the evaluation classes. However, we also want to look at the grids generated. This again can be done with one such class. Its structure is analog to the <code>SolutionOutput</code> class of the previous example program, so we do not discuss it here in more detail. Furthermore, everything that is used here has already been used in previous example programs.</p>

First, the constructor initializes all data elements to their correct sizes, and sets up a number of additional data structures, such as constraints due to hanging nodes. Since setting up the hanging nodes and finding out about the nonzero elements of the matrix is independent, we do that in parallel (if the library was configured to use concurrency, at least; otherwise, the actions are performed sequentially). Note that we start only one thread, and do the second action in the main thread. Since only one thread is generated, we don't use the <code><a class="el" href="classThreads_1_1TaskGroup.html">Threads::TaskGroup</a></code> class here, but rather use the one created task object directly to wait for this particular task's exit. The approach is generally the same as the one we have used in <code>Solver::assemble_linear_system()</code> above. Note that taking the address of the <code><a class="el" href="group__constraints.html#ga3b4ea7dfd313e388d868c4e4aa685799">DoFTools::make_hanging_node_constraints</a></code> function is a little tricky, since there are actually three functions of this name, one for each supported space dimension. Taking addresses of overloaded functions is somewhat complicated in C++, since the address-of operator <code>&amp;</code> in that case returns a set of values (the addresses of all functions with that name), and selecting the right one is then the next step. If the context dictates which one to take (for example by assigning to a function pointer of known type), then the compiler can do that by itself, but if this set of pointers shall be given as the argument to a function that takes a template, the compiler could choose all without having a preference for one. We therefore have to make it clear to the compiler which one we would like to have; for this, we could use a cast, but for more clarity, we assign it to a temporary <code>mhnc_p</code> (short for <code>pointer to make_hanging_node_constraints</code>) with the right type, and using this pointer instead.</p>

<p>This class is a variant of the previous one, in that it allows to weight the refinement indicators we get from the library's Kelly indicator by some function. We include this class since the goal of this example program is to demonstrate automatic refinement criteria even for complex output quantities such as point values or stresses. If we did not solve a dual problem and compute the weights thereof, we would probably be tempted to give a hand-crafted weighting to the indicators to account for the fact that we are going to evaluate these quantities. This class accepts such a weighting function as argument to its constructor:</p>

<p>In this example program, we work with the same data sets as in the previous one, but as it may so happen that someone wants to run the program with different boundary values and right hand side functions, or on a different grid, we show a simple technique to do exactly that. For more clarity, we furthermore pack everything that has to do with equation data into a namespace of its own. The underlying assumption is that this is a research program, and that there we often have a number of test cases that consist of a domain, a right hand side, boundary values, possibly a specified coefficient, and a number of other parameters. They often vary all at the same time when shifting from one example to another. To make handling such sets of problem description parameters simple is the goal of the following. Basically, the idea is this: let us have a structure for each set of data, in which we pack everything that describes a test case: here, these are two subclasses, one called <code>BoundaryValues</code> for the boundary values of the exact solution, and one called <code>RightHandSide</code> , and then a way to generate the coarse grid. Since the solution of the previous example program looked like curved ridges, we use this name here for the enclosing class. Note that the names of the two inner classes have to be the same for all enclosing test case classes, and also that we have attached the dimension template argument to the enclosing class rather than to the inner ones, to make further processing simpler. (From a language viewpoint, a namespace would be better to encapsulate these inner classes, rather than a structure. However, namespaces cannot be given as template arguments, so we use a structure to allow a second object to select from within its given argument. The enclosing structure, of course, has no member variables apart from the classes it declares, and a static function to generate the coarse mesh; it will in general never be instantiated.) The idea is then the following (this is the right time to also take a brief look at the code below): we can generate objects for boundary values and right hand side by simply giving the name of the outer class as a template argument to a class which we call here <code>Data::SetUp</code> , and it then creates objects for the inner classes. In this case, to get all that characterizes the curved ridge solution, we would simply generate an instance of <code>Data::SetUp&lt;Data::CurvedRidge&gt;</code> , and everything we need to know about the solution would be static member variables and functions of that object. This approach might seem like overkill in this case, but will become very handy once a certain set up is not only characterized by Dirichlet boundary values and a right hand side function, but in addition by material properties, Neumann values, different boundary descriptors, etc. In that case, the <code>SetUp</code> class might consist of a dozen or more objects, and each descriptor class (like the <code>CurvedRidges</code> class below) would have to provide them. Then, you will be happy to be able to change from one set of data to another by only changing the template argument to the <code>SetUp</code> class at one place, rather than at many. With this framework for different test cases, we are almost finished, but one thing remains: by now we can select statically, by changing one template argument, which data set to choose. In order to be able to do that dynamically, i.e. at run time, we need a base class. This we provide in the obvious way, see below, with virtual abstract functions. It forces us to introduce a second template parameter <code>dim</code> which we need for the base class (which could be avoided using some template magic, but we omit that), but that's all. Adding new testcases is now simple, you don't have to touch the framework classes, only a structure like the <code>CurvedRidges</code> one is needed.</p>

<p>Based on the above description, the <code>SetUpBase</code> class then looks as follows.

<p>This example program was written while giving practical courses for a lecture on adaptive finite element methods and duality based error estimates. For these courses, we had one exercise, which required to solve the Laplace equation with constant right hand side on a square domain with a square hole in the center, and zero boundary values. Since the implementation of the properties of this problem is so particularly simple here, lets do it. As the number of the exercise was 2.3, we take the liberty to retain this name for the class as well.</p>

To understand how exactly the mesh is going to look, it may be simplest to just look at the "Results" section of this tutorial program first. In general, if you'd like to understand more about creating meshes either from scratch by hand, as we do here, or using other techniques, you should take a look at <a class="el" href="step_49.html">step-49</a> . Of course, the example has an extension to 3d, but since this function cannot be written in a dimension independent way we choose not to implement this here, but rather only specialize the template for dim=2. If you compile the program for 3d, you'll get a message from the linker that this function is not implemented for 3d, and needs to be provided. For the creation of this geometry, the library has no predefined method. In this case, the geometry is still simple enough to do the creation by hand, rather than using a mesh generator.</p>

Here, they are 24 (5 times 5, with the middle one omitted). It is probably best to draw a sketch here.</p>

<p>As you have now read through this framework, you may be wondering why we have not chosen to implement the classes implementing a certain setup (like the <code>CurvedRidges</code> class) directly as classes derived from <code>Data::SetUpBase</code> . Indeed, we could have done very well so. The only reason is that then we would have to have member variables for the solution and right hand side classes in the <code>CurvedRidges</code> class, as well as member functions overloading the abstract functions of the base class giving access to these member variables. The <code>SetUp</code> class has the sole reason to relieve us from the need to reiterate these member variables and functions that would be necessary in all such classes. In some way, the template mechanism here only provides a way to have default implementations for a number of functions that depend on external quantities and can thus not be provided using normal virtual functions, at least not without the help of templates. However, there might be good reasons to actually implement classes derived from <code>Data::SetUpBase</code> , for example if the solution or right hand side classes require constructors that take arguments, which the <code>Data::SetUpBase</code> class cannot provide. In that case, subclassing is a worthwhile strategy. Other possibilities for special cases are to derive from <code>Data::SetUp&lt;SomeSetUp&gt;</code> where <code>SomeSetUp</code> denotes a class, or even to explicitly specialize <code>Data::SetUp&lt;SomeSetUp&gt;</code> . The latter allows to transparently use the way the <code>SetUp</code> class is used for other set-ups, but with special actions taken for special arguments. A final observation favoring the approach taken here is the following: we have found numerous times that when starting a project, the number of parameters (usually boundary values, right hand side, coarse grid, just as here) was small, and the number of test cases was small as well. One then starts out by handcoding them into a number of <code>switch</code> statements. Over time, projects grow, and so does the number of test cases. The number of <code>switch</code> statements grows with that, and their length as well, and one starts to find ways to consider impossible examples where domains, boundary values, and right hand sides do not fit together any more, and starts losing the overview over the whole structure. Encapsulating everything belonging to a certain test case into a structure of its own has proven worthwhile for this, as it keeps everything that belongs to one test case in one place. Furthermore, it allows to put these things all in one or more files that are only devoted to test cases and their data, without having to bring their actual implementation into contact with the rest of the program.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Dualfunctionals"></a> </p><h3>Dual functionals</h3>
<p>As with the other components of the program, we put everything we need to describe dual functionals into a namespace of its own, and define an abstract base class that provides the interface the class solving the dual problem needs for its work. We will then implement two such classes, for the evaluation of a point value and of the derivative of the solution at that point. For these functionals we already have the corresponding evaluation objects, so they are complementary.</p>

<p>First start with the base class for dual functionals. Since for linear problems the characteristics of the dual problem play a role only in the right hand side, we only need to provide for a function that assembles the right hand side for a given discretization:</p>

<p>As a first application, we consider the functional corresponding to the evaluation of the solution's value at a given point which again we assume to be a vertex.

Here, J is the evaluation at the point x0, i.e. J(phi_i)=phi_i(x0). Now, we have assumed that the evaluation point is a vertex. Thus, for the usual finite elements we might be using in this program, we can take for granted that at such a point exactly one shape function is nonzero, and in particular has the value one. Thus, we set the right hand side vector to all-zeros, then seek for the shape function associated with that point and set the corresponding value of the right hand side vector to one:</p>

We could, as in the implementation of the respective evaluation object take the average of the gradients of each shape function phi_i at this evaluation point. However, we take a slightly different approach: we simply take the average over all cells that surround this point. The question which cells <code>surrounds</code> the evaluation point is made dependent on the mesh width by including those cells for which the distance of the cell's midpoint to the evaluation point is less than the cell's diameter. Taking the average of the gradient over the area/volume of these cells leads to a dual solution which is very close to the one which would result from the point evaluation of the gradient. It is simple to justify theoretically that this does not change the method significantly.</p>

<p>In the same way as the <code>PrimalSolver</code> class above, we now implement a <code>DualSolver</code> . It has all the same features, the only difference is that it does not take a function object denoting a right hand side object, but now takes a <code>DualFunctionalBase</code> object that will assemble the right hand side vector of the dual problem. The rest of the class is rather trivial. Since both primal and dual solver will use the same triangulation, but different discretizations, it now becomes clear why we have made the <code>Base</code> class a virtual one: since the final class will be derived from both <code>PrimalSolver</code> as well as <code>DualSolver</code>, it would have two <code>Base</code> instances, would we not have marked the inheritance as virtual. Since in many applications the base class would store much more information than just the triangulation which needs to be shared between primal and dual solvers, we do not usually want to use two such base classes.</p>

<p>Here finally comes the main class of this program, the one that implements the dual weighted residual error estimator. It joins the primal and dual solver classes to use them for the computation of primal and dual solutions, and implements the error representation formula for use as error estimate and mesh refinement. The first few of the functions of this class are mostly overriders of the respective functions of the base class:</p>

The idea is that we can compute the face terms from each of the two cells to this face, as they are the same when viewed from both sides. What we will do is to compute them only once, based on some rules explained below which of the two adjacent cells will be in charge to do so. We then store the contribution of each face in a map mapping faces to their values, and only collect the contributions for each cell by looping over the cells a second time and grabbing the values from the map. The data type of this map is declared here:</p>

These fields are needed in the three functions that do the integration on cells, and regular and irregular faces, respectively. There are three reasonable ways to provide these fields: first, as local variables in the function that needs them; second, as member variables of this class; third, as arguments passed to that function. These three alternatives all have drawbacks: the third that their number is not negligible and would make calling these functions a lengthy enterprise. The second has the drawback that it disallows parallelization, since the threads that will compute the error estimate have to have their own copies of these variables each, so member variables of the enclosing class will not work. The first approach, although straightforward, has a subtle but important drawback: we will call these functions over and over again, many thousands of times maybe; it now turns out that allocating vectors and other objects that need memory from the heap is an expensive business in terms of run-time, since memory allocation is expensive when several threads are involved. It is thus significantly better to allocate the memory only once, and recycle the objects as often as possible. What to do? Our answer is to use a variant of the third strategy. In fact, this is exactly what the <a class="el" href="namespaceWorkStream.html">WorkStream</a> concept is supposed to do (we have already introduced it above, but see also <a class="el" href="group__threads.html">Parallel computing with multiple processors accessing</a> ). To avoid that we have to give these functions a dozen or so arguments, we pack all these variables into two structures, one which is used for the computations on cells, the other doing them on the faces.

As for the actual computation of error estimates, let's start with the function that drives all this, i.e. calls those functions that actually do the work, and finally collects the results.
</pre><div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">template</span> &lt;<span class="keywordtype">int</span> dim&gt;</div><div class="line"><span class="keywordtype">void</span></div><div class="line">WeightedResidual&lt;dim&gt;::estimate_error(<a class="code" href="classVector.html">Vector&lt;float&gt;</a> &amp;error_indicators)<span class="keyword"> const</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword"></span>{</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>The first task in computing the error is to set up vectors that denote the primal solution, and the weights (z-z_h)=(z-I_hz), both in the finite element space for which we have computed the dual solution. For this, we have to interpolate the primal solution to the dual finite element space, and to subtract the interpolation of the computed dual solution to the primal finite element space. Fortunately, the library provides functions for the interpolation into larger or smaller finite element spaces, so this is mostly obvious. First, let's do that for the primal solution: it is cell-wise interpolated into the finite element space in which we have solved the dual problem: But, again as in the <code>WeightedResidual::output_solution</code> function we first need to create an <a class="el" href="classAffineConstraints.html">AffineConstraints</a> object including the hanging node constraints, but this time of the dual finite element space.</p>

We leave the optimization of the program in this respect as an exercise.</p>
<p>Having computed the dual weights we now proceed with computing the cell and face residuals of the primal solution. First we set up a map between face iterators and their jump term contributions of faces to the error estimator. The reason is that we compute the jump terms only once, from one side of the face, and want to collect them only afterwards when looping over all cells a second time. We initialize this map already with a value of</p>
<ul>
<li>e20 for all faces, since this value will stand out in the results if something should go wrong and we fail to compute the value for a face for some reason. Secondly, this initialization already makes the std::map object allocate all objects it may possibly need. This is important since we will write into this structure from parallel threads, and doing so would not be thread-safe if the map needed to allocate memory and thereby reshape its data structures.

<p>In the previous example program, we have had two functions that were used to drive the process of solving on subsequently finer grids. We extend this here to allow for a number of parameters to be passed to these functions, and put all of that into framework class. You will have noted that this program is built up of a number of small parts (evaluation functions, solver classes implementing various refinement methods, different dual functionals, different problem and data descriptions), which makes the program relatively simple to extend, but also allows to solve a large number of different problems by replacing one part by another. We reflect this flexibility by declaring a structure in the following framework class that holds a number of parameters that may be set to test various combinations of the parts of this program, and which can be used to test it at various problems and discretizations in a simple way.</p>

<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">struct </span>ProblemDescription</div><div class="line">{</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>First allow for the degrees of the piecewise polynomials by which the primal and dual problems will be discretized.

<div class="fragment"><div class="line">EvaluatorList evaluator_list;</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Next to last, a function that is used as a weight to the <code>RefinementWeightedKelly</code> class.

<div class="fragment"><div class="line">std::unique_ptr&lt;const Function&lt;dim&gt;&gt; kelly_weight;</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Finally, we have a variable that denotes the maximum number of degrees of freedom we allow for the (primal) discretization.

<p>Note the subtle interplay between resolving the corner singularities,and resolving around the point of evaluation. It will be ratherdifficult to generate such a mesh by hand, as this would involve tojudge quantitatively how much which of the four corner singularitiesshould be resolved, and to set the weight compared to the vicinity ofthe evaluation point.</p>
<p>The program prints the point value and the estimated error in thisquantity. From extrapolating it, we can guess that the exact value issomewhere close to 0.0334473, plus or minus 0.0000001 (note that we getalmost 6 valid digits from only 22,000 (primal) degrees offreedom. This number cannot be obtained from the value of thefunctional alone, but I have used the assumption that the errorestimator is mostly exact, and extrapolated the computed value plusthe estimated error, to get an approximation of the truevalue. Computing with more degrees of freedom shows that thisassumption is indeed valid.</p>
<p>From the computed results, we can generate two graphs: one that showsthe convergence of the error \(J(u)-J(u_h)\) (taking theextrapolated value as correct) in the point value, and the value thatwe get by adding up computed value \(J(u_h)\) and estimatederror eta (if the error estimator \(eta\) were exact, then the value \(J(u_h)+\eta\) would equal the exact point value, and the errorin this quantity would always be zero; however, since the errorestimator is only a</p>
<ul>
<li>good</li>
<li>approximation to the true error, we canby this only reduce the size of the error). In this graph, we alsoindicate the complexity \({\cal O}(1/N)\) to show that mesh refinementacts optimal in this case. The second chart comparestrue and estimated error, and shows that the two are actually veryclose to each other, even for such a complicated quantity as the pointvalue:</li>

  <p><a class="anchor" id="Comparingrefinementcriteria"></a></p><h3>Comparing refinement criteria</h3>
<p>Since we have accepted quite some effort when using the meshrefinement driven by the dual weighted error estimator (for solvingthe dual problem, and for evaluating the error representation), it isworth while asking whether that effort was successful. To this end, wefirst compare the achieved error levels for different mesh refinementcriteria. To generate this data, simply change the value of the meshrefinement criterion variable in the main program. The results arethus (for the weight in the Kelly indicator, we have chosen thefunction \(1/(r^2+0.1^2)\) , where \(r\) is the distance to the evaluation point; it can be shown that this isthe optimal weight if we neglect the effects of boundaries): </p><div class="image">
<img src="https://www.dealii.org/images/steps/developer/step-14.point-value.error-comparison.png"/>
</div>
<p>Checking these numbers, we see that for global refinement, the erroris proportional to \(O(1/(sqrt(N) log(N)))\) , and for the dualestimator \(O(1/N)\) . Generally speaking, we see that the dualweighted error estimator is better than the other refinementindicators, at least when compared with those that have a similarlyregular behavior. The Kelly indicator produces smaller errors, butjumps about the picture rather irregularly, with the error alsochanging signs sometimes. Therefore, its behavior does not allow toextrapolate the results to larger values of N. Furthermore, if wetrust the error estimates of the dual weighted error estimator, theresults can be improved by adding the estimated error to the computedvalues. In terms of reliability, the weighted estimator is thus betterthan the Kelly indicator, although the latter sometimes producessmaller errors.</p>

<p>Note the asymmetry of the grids compared with those we obtained forthe point evaluation. This is due to the fact that the domain and the primalsolution may be symmetric about the diagonal, but the \(x\) -derivative isnot, and the latter enters the refinement criterion.</p>
<p>Then, it is interesting to compare actually computed values of thequantity of interest (i.e. the x-derivative of the solution at onepoint) with a reference value of</p>
<ul>
<li>.0528223... plus or minus0.0000005. We get this reference value by computing on finer grid aftersome more mesh refinements, with approximately 130,000 cells.Recall that if the error is \(O(1/N)\) in the optimal case, thentaking a mesh with ten times more cells gives us one additional digitin the result.</li>

<p>If instead of the <code>Exercise_2_3</code> data set, we choose <code>CurvedRidges</code> in the main function, and choose \((0.5,0.5)\) as the evaluation point, then we can redo thecomputations of the previous example program, to compare whether theresults obtained with the help of the dual weighted error estimatorare better than those we had previously.</p>
<p>First, the meshes after 9 adaptive refinement cycles obtained withthe point evaluation and derivative evaluation refinementcriteria, respectively, look like this: </p><table width="80%" align="center">

<p>The features of the solution can still be seen in the mesh, but since thesolution is smooth, the singularities of the dual solution entirelydominate the mesh refinement criterion, and lead to stronglyconcentrated meshes. The solution after the seventh refinement step lookslike the following: </p><table width="40%" align="center">

<p>Obviously, the solution is worse at some places, but the meshrefinement process should have taken care that these places are notimportant for computing the point value.</p>
<p>The next point is to compare the new (duality based) mesh refinementcriterion with the old ones. These are the results: </p><div class="image">
<img src="https://www.dealii.org/images/steps/developer/step-14.step-13.error-comparison.png"/>
</div>
<p>The results are, well, somewhat mixed. First, the Kelly indicatordisqualifies itself by its unsteady behavior, changing the sign of theerror several times, and with increasing errors under meshrefinement. The dual weighted error estimator has a monotone decreasein the error, and is better than the weighted Kelly and globalrefinement, but the margin is not as large as expected. This is, here,due to the fact the global refinement can exploit the regularstructure of the meshes around the point of evaluation, which leads toa better order of convergence for the point error. However, if we hada mesh that is not locally rectangular, for example because we had toapproximate curved boundaries, or if the coefficients were notconstant, then this advantage of globally refinement meshes wouldvanish, while the good performance of the duality based estimatorwould remain.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Conclusionsandoutlook"></a></p><h3>Conclusions and outlook</h3>
<p>The results here are not too clearly indicating the superiority of thedual weighted error estimation approach for mesh refinement over othermesh refinement criteria, such as the Kelly indicator. This is due tothe relative simplicity of the shown applications. If you are notconvinced yet that this approach is indeed superior, you are invitedto browse through the literature indicated in the introduction, whereplenty of examples are provided where the dual weighted approach canreduce the necessary numerical work by orders of magnitude, makingthis the only way to compute certain quantities to reasonableaccuracies at all.</p>
<p>Besides the objections you may raise against its use as a meshrefinement criterion, consider that accurate knowledge of the error inthe quantity one might want to compute is of great use, since we canstop computations when we are satisfied with the accuracy. Using moretraditional approaches, it is very difficult to get accurate estimatesfor arbitrary quantities, except for, maybe, the error in the energynorm, and we will then have no guarantee that the result we computedsatisfies any requirements on its accuracy. Also, as was shown for theevaluation of point values and derivatives, the error estimate can beused to extrapolate the results, yielding much higher accuracy in thequantity we want to know.</p>
<p>Leaving these mathematical considerations, we tried to write theprogram in a modular way, such that implementing another test case, oranother evaluation and dual functional is simple. You are encouragedto take the program as a basis for your own experiments, and to play alittle.</p>

<p><a class="anchor" id="Themaths"></a></p><h3>The maths</h3>
<p>Rolf Rannacher教授的海德堡小组，deal.II库的三位最初的作者在他们的博士期间和部分之后都属于该小组，自90年代中期以来一直从事有限元离散的适应性和误差估计的研究。其主要成就是开发了任意函数的误差估计，以及用于计算的最佳网格细化。</p>
<p>我们不会太详细地讨论这些概念的推导，但会在本例程序中实现主要思想。对于一般概念的彻底介绍，我们参考Becker和Rannacher的开创性工作 <b>[BR95]</b> ， <b>[BR96r]</b> ，以及同一作者在Acta Numerica <b>[BR01]</b> 上的概述文章；前者介绍了拉普拉斯方程的误差估计和一般函数输出的适应性概念，而后者给出了这些概念在大量其他更复杂方程中的应用例子。关于个别类型方程的应用，也可参见Becker <b>[Bec95]</b> , <b>[Bec98]</b> , Kanschat <b>[Kan96]</b> , <b>[FK97]</b> , Suttmeier <b>[Sut96]</b> 的出版物。] , <b>[RS97]</b> , <b>[RS98c]</b> , <b>[RS99]</b> , 班格特 <b>[BR99b]</b> , <b>[Ban00w]</b> , <b>[BR01a]</b> , <b>[Ban02]</b> , 和哈特曼 <b>[Har02]</b> , <b>[HH01]</b> , <b>[HH01b]</b> 。所有这些工作，从Becker和Rannacher的原始介绍到对特定方程的个别贡献，后来都被Bangerth和Rannacher总结成一本书，涵盖所有这些主题，见 <b>[BR03]</b> 。</p>
<p>其基本思想如下：在应用中，人们通常对解本身不感兴趣，而是对它的某些方面感兴趣。例如，在流动问题的模拟中，人们可能想知道浸在流体中的物体的升力或阻力；我们想知道的是这个量的最佳精度，而描述方程的其余解是否得到很好的解决并不是主要兴趣。同样，在弹性方面，人们可能想知道某些点的应力值，以猜测关节的最大负荷值是否安全，例如。或者，在辐射传输问题中，平均通量强度是有意义的。</p>
<p>在刚才列举的所有情况中，我们感兴趣的是解的函数 \(J(u)\) 的评估，而不是各地的 \(u\) 的值。由于精确的解决方案 \(u\) 是不可用的，只有它的数字近似值 \(u_h\) ，所以询问计算值 \(J(u_h)\) 是否在精确值 \(J(u)\) 的一定范围内是明智的，也就是说，我们要约束与这个函数有关的误差， \(J(u)-J(u_h)\) 。</p>
<p>为了简化论述，我们假设感兴趣的量 \(J\) 以及方程都是线性的，我们将特别展示具有同质Dirichlet边界条件的拉普拉斯方程的推导，尽管这一概念更为普遍。对于这种一般情况，我们参考上面列出的参考文献。 我们的目标是获得误差的界限， \(J(e)=J(u)-J(u_h)\) 。为此，让我们用 \(z\) 表示对偶问题的解，定义如下。</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\[ a(\varphi,z) = J(\varphi) \qquad \forall \varphi, \]
</p>
<p>其中 \(a(\cdot,\cdot)\) 是与微分方程相关的双线性形式，测试函数从相应的解空间中选择。然后，以特殊的检验函数 \(\varphi=e\) 作为误差，我们有</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\[ J(e) = a(e,z) \]
</p>
<p>根据加尔金正交性，我们可以将其改写为</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\[ J(e) = a(e,z-\varphi_h) \]
</p>
<p>其中 \(\varphi_h\) 可以用我们认为方便的任何方式从离散测试空间中选择。</p>
<p>具体来说，对于拉普拉斯方程来说，其误差特性为</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\[ J(e) = (\nabla e, \nabla(z-\varphi_h)). \]
</p>
<p>因为我们不仅要用这个公式来计算误差，而且还要细化网格，所以我们需要将上面的表达式改写为单元格之和，每个单元格的贡献可以作为这个单元格的误差指标。因此，我们将标量产品分成每个单元的条款，并对每个单元进行分项积分。</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} J(e) &amp;=&amp; \sum_K (\nabla (u-u_h), \nabla (z-\varphi_h))_K \\ &amp;=&amp; \sum_K (-\Delta (u-u_h), z-\varphi_h)_K + (\partial_n (u-u_h), z-z_h)_{\partial K}. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p>接下来我们使用 \(-\Delta u=f\) ，对于拉普拉斯方程的解来说，该解足够平滑， \(\partial_n u\) 几乎在任何地方都是连续的&ndash;因此在一个单元上涉及 \(\partial_n u\) 的项与它的邻居上的项相抵消，其中法向量的符号相反。(不过 \(\partial_n u_h\) 的情况并非如此。)在域的边界，没有可以抵消这个项的邻接单元，权重 \(z-\varphi_h\) 可以选择为零，而整个项就消失了。</p>
<p>因此，我们有</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} J(e) &amp;=&amp; \sum_K (f+\Delta u_h, z-\varphi_h)_K - (\partial_n u_h, z-\varphi_h)_{\partial K\backslash \partial\Omega}. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p>在最后一步，注意当取 \(u_h\) 的法向导数时，我们指的是从单元格的这一边取的这个量的值（对于通常的拉格朗日元素，导数不是跨边连续的）。然后我们重写上述公式，将单元格 \(K\) 的一半边缘积分与相邻单元格 \(K&#39;\) 交换，得到</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} J(e) &amp;=&amp; \sum_K (f+\Delta u_h, z-\varphi_h)_K - \frac 12 (\partial_n u_h|_K + \partial_{n&#39;} u_h|_{K&#39;}, z-\varphi_h)_{\partial K\backslash \partial\Omega}. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p>利用对于相邻单元格上的法向量，我们有 \(n&#39;=-n\) ，我们定义法向导数的跳跃为</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\[ [\partial_n u_h] \dealcoloneq \partial_n u_h|_K + \partial_{n&#39;} u_h|_{K&#39;} = \partial_n u_h|_K - \partial_n u_h|_{K&#39;}, \]
</p>
<p>并在将离散函数 \(\varphi_h\) 设置为对偶解的点插值后得到最终形式， \(\varphi_h=I_h z\) ，现在它仍然是任意的。</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{eqnarray*} J(e) &amp;=&amp; \sum_K (f+\Delta u_h, z-I_h z)_K - \frac 12 ([\partial_n u_h], z-I_h z)_{\partial K\backslash \partial\Omega}. \end{eqnarray*}
</p>
<p>借此，我们得到了关于任意（线性）函数的有限元离散化误差的精确表示 \(J(\cdot)\) 。其结构是残差估计的加权形式，因为 \(f+\Delta u_h\) 和 \([\partial_n u_h]\) 都是在精确解上消失的单元和边缘残差，而 \(z-I_h z\) 是表示某个单元上的残差对于给定函数的评估有多重要的权重。此外，它是一个面向单元的量，所以我们可以把它作为一个网格细化的标准。问题是：如何评估它？毕竟，评估需要了解对偶解 \(z\) ，它带有我们想要知道的最准确的数量的信息。</p>
<p>在一些非常特殊的情况下，这个对偶解是已知的。例如，如果函数 \(J(\cdot)\) 是点评估， \(J(\varphi)=\varphi(x_0)\) ，那么对偶解必须满足</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\[ -\Delta z = \delta(x-x_0), \]
</p>
<p>右手边是狄拉克三角函数，对偶解是关于点 \(x_0\) 的格林函数。对于简单的几何形状，这个函数是分析上已知的，我们可以把它插入误差表示公式中。</p>
<p>然而，我们不想把自己限制在这种特殊情况下。相反，我们将以数值方式计算对偶解，并通过一些数值获得的 \(\tilde z\) 来近似 \(z\) 。我们注意到，使用与原始解 \(u_h\) 相同的方法来计算这个近似值 \(\tilde z\) 是不够的，因为这样 \(\tilde z-I_h \tilde z=0\) 和整体误差估计值将为零。相反，近似值 \(\tilde z\) 必须来自一个比原始有限元空间更大的空间。有多种方法可以获得这样的近似值（见所引用的文献），我们将选择用高阶有限元空间来计算它。虽然这肯定不是最有效的方法，但它很简单，因为我们已经有了所有需要做的事情，而且还可以进行简单的实验。对于更有效的方法，再次参考给定的文献，特别是 <b>[BR95]</b> , <b>[BR03]</b> 。</p>
<p>至此，我们结束了对这个程序的数学方面的讨论，转而讨论实际的实施。</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>如果你只关心计算误差的话，上面有两个步骤似乎没有必要：即(i)从 \(z\) 中减去 \(\phi_h\) ，以及(ii)将积分拆成单元格之和，并对每个单元格进行积分。事实上，这两个步骤根本没有改变 \(J(e)\) ，因为在用 \(\tilde z\) 替换 \(z\) 之前，我们只考虑上面的相同点。换句话说，如果你只关心<em>estimating the global error</em> \(J(e)\) ，那么这些步骤就没有必要。另一方面，如果你想把误差估计值也作为网格中每个单元的细化标准，那么就有必要(i)把估计值分解成单元的总和，(ii)以这样的方式按摩公式，使每个单元的贡献都与局部误差有关。(虽然上面的扭曲没有改变<em>sum</em> \(J(e)\) 的值，但它们改变了我们为每个单元 \(K\) 计算的值) 。为此，我们想把一切都写成 "残差乘以双重权重 "的形式，其中 "残差 "是随着近似度变得 \(u_h\) 越来越好而归于零的东西。例如， \(\partial_n u_h\) 这个量不是残差，因为它只是收敛到精确解的梯度的（法线分量）。另一方面， \([\partial_n u_h]\) 是一个残差，因为它收敛于 \([\partial_n u]=0\) 。我们在制定 \(J(e)\) 的最终形式时采取的所有步骤，实际上都是为了使最终公式变成一种形式，即当离散解 \(u_h\) 收敛到 \(u\) 时，每个项都收敛为零。这样就可以把每个单元的贡献看作是一个 "误差指标"，也会收敛为零&ndash;因为它应该随着网格的细化而收敛。</dd></dl>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Thesoftware"></a></p><h3>The software</h3>
<p>第14步的例子程序在很大程度上建立在第13步程序中已经使用的技术上。它对上面解释的双重加权残差估计器的实现是通过派生出第二个类，正确地称为 <code>DualSolver</code>, from the <code>Solver</code> 基类，并有一个类( <code>WeightedResidual</code> )将两者再次连接起来，控制原始和双重问题的解决，然后用两者来计算网格细化的误差指标。</p>
<p>这个程序延续了上一个例子的模块化概念，通过一个抽象的基类来实现双重功能，描述感兴趣的数量，并提供两个不同的功能来实现这个接口。因此，增加一个不同的兴趣量是很简单的。</p>
<p>其中一个更根本的区别是对数据的处理。一个常见的情况是，你开发了一个解决某个方程的程序，并用不同的右手边、不同的域、不同的系数和边界值等来测试它。通常情况下，这些都必须匹配，这样才能知道确切的解决方案，或者它们的组合根本就有意义。</p>
<p>我们将演示如何以一种简单而又非常灵活的方式实现这一目标。我们将把属于某个设置的所有东西放到一个类中，并围绕它提供一个小的C++砂浆，这样整个设置（域、系数、右手边等）就可以通过只改变 <em> 中的某个 </em> 地方来交换。</p>
<p>再进一步，我们还将所有描述程序如何工作的其他参数集中在一个地方，如有限元的顺序、最大自由度数、对计算出的解应执行的评估对象等等。这使得程序的配置更加简单，我们将在后面的程序中展示如何使用一个库类来处理通过读取输入文件来设置这些参数。总的来说，我们的目的是要减少程序中想要改变某些参数时可能需要查找的地方，因为在实践中发现，随着程序的发展，人们会忘记它们的位置。此外，把所有描述程序在某次运行中的选项放到一个文件中（可以和结果一起存储），比在程序中的某个地方设置各种标志更有助于结果的可重复性，因为在下次改变这个地方后，它们的准确值就会被遗忘。</p>
<p>不幸的是，这个程序已经变得相当长了。虽然这无疑降低了它作为一个示例程序的作用，但我们认为它是一个很好的起点，可以为其他类型的问题开发一个程序，涉及不同于这里处理的拉普拉斯方程的方程。此外，它显示了我们可以向你展示的关于我们的后验误差估计方法的一切，它的结构应该使你能够简单地调整这个方法以适应其他问题、其他函数、其他几何形状、系数等等。</p>
<p>作者认为，就数学的复杂性和添加扩展的简单性而言，本程序是他在范例程序中的杰作。如果你使用这个程序作为你自己程序的基础，我们希望你能在出版物中说明这一事实以及示例程序的作者Wolfgang Bangerth的名字，因为你的程序有相当一部分是由示例程序组成的。</p>

<p>Besides the class implementing the evaluation of the solution at one point, we here provide one which evaluates the gradient at a grid point. Since in general the gradient of a finite element function is not continuous at a vertex, we have to be a little bit more careful here. What we do is to loop over all cells, even if we have found the point already on one cell, and use the mean value of the gradient at the vertex taken from all adjacent cells.</p>
<p>Given the interface of the <code>PointValueEvaluation</code> class, the declaration of this class provides little surprise, and neither does the constructor:</p>

<p>Rather, we have to evaluate the finite element field on this cell, and at a certain point. As you know, evaluating finite element fields at certain points is done through the <code><a class="el" href="classFEValues.html">FEValues</a></code> class, so we use that. The question is: the <code><a class="el" href="classFEValues.html">FEValues</a></code> object needs to be a given a quadrature formula and can then compute the values of finite element quantities at the quadrature points. Here, we don't want to do quadrature, we simply want to specify some points!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the same way is chosen: use a special quadrature rule with points at the vertices, since these are what we are interested in. The appropriate rule is the trapezoidal rule, so that is the reason why we used that one above.</p>
<p>Thus: initialize the <code><a class="el" href="classFEValues.html">FEValues</a></code> object on this cell,</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">fe_values.reinit(cell);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>and extract the gradients of the solution vector at the vertices:</p>

<p>Since this program has a more difficult structure (it computed a dual solution in addition to a primal one), writing out the solution is no more done by an evaluation object since we want to write both solutions at once into one file, and that requires some more information than available to the evaluation classes.</p>
<p>However, we also want to look at the grids generated. This again can be done with one such class. Its structure is analog to the <code>SolutionOutput</code> class of the previous example program, so we do not discuss it here in more detail. Furthermore, everything that is used here has already been used in previous example programs.</p>

<p>This class is almost unchanged, with the exception that it declares two more functions: <code>output_solution</code> will be used to generate output files from the actual solutions computed by derived classes, and the <code>set_refinement_cycle</code> function by which the testing framework sets the number of the refinement cycle to a local variable in this class; this number is later used to generate filenames for the solution output.</p>

First, the constructor initializes all data elements to their correct sizes, and sets up a number of additional data structures, such as constraints due to hanging nodes. Since setting up the hanging nodes and finding out about the nonzero elements of the matrix is independent, we do that in parallel (if the library was configured to use concurrency, at least; otherwise, the actions are performed sequentially). Note that we start only one thread, and do the second action in the main thread. Since only one thread is generated, we don't use the <code><a class="el" href="classThreads_1_1TaskGroup.html">Threads::TaskGroup</a></code> class here, but rather use the one created task object directly to wait for this particular task's exit. The approach is generally the same as the one we have used in <code>Solver::assemble_linear_system()</code> above.</p>
<p>Note that taking the address of the <code><a class="el" href="group__constraints.html#ga3b4ea7dfd313e388d868c4e4aa685799">DoFTools::make_hanging_node_constraints</a></code> function is a little tricky, since there are actually three functions of this name, one for each supported space dimension. Taking addresses of overloaded functions is somewhat complicated in C++, since the address-of operator <code>&amp;</code> in that case returns a set of values (the addresses of all functions with that name), and selecting the right one is then the next step. If the context dictates which one to take (for example by assigning to a function pointer of known type), then the compiler can do that by itself, but if this set of pointers shall be given as the argument to a function that takes a template, the compiler could choose all without having a preference for one. We therefore have to make it clear to the compiler which one we would like to have; for this, we could use a cast, but for more clarity, we assign it to a temporary <code>mhnc_p</code> (short for <code>pointer to make_hanging_node_constraints</code>) with the right type, and using this pointer instead.</p>

<p>This class is a variant of the previous one, in that it allows to weight the refinement indicators we get from the library's Kelly indicator by some function. We include this class since the goal of this example program is to demonstrate automatic refinement criteria even for complex output quantities such as point values or stresses. If we did not solve a dual problem and compute the weights thereof, we would probably be tempted to give a hand-crafted weighting to the indicators to account for the fact that we are going to evaluate these quantities. This class accepts such a weighting function as argument to its constructor:</p>

<p>In this example program, we work with the same data sets as in the previous one, but as it may so happen that someone wants to run the program with different boundary values and right hand side functions, or on a different grid, we show a simple technique to do exactly that. For more clarity, we furthermore pack everything that has to do with equation data into a namespace of its own.</p>
<p>The underlying assumption is that this is a research program, and that there we often have a number of test cases that consist of a domain, a right hand side, boundary values, possibly a specified coefficient, and a number of other parameters. They often vary all at the same time when shifting from one example to another. To make handling such sets of problem description parameters simple is the goal of the following.</p>
<p>Basically, the idea is this: let us have a structure for each set of data, in which we pack everything that describes a test case: here, these are two subclasses, one called <code>BoundaryValues</code> for the boundary values of the exact solution, and one called <code>RightHandSide</code>, and then a way to generate the coarse grid. Since the solution of the previous example program looked like curved ridges, we use this name here for the enclosing class. Note that the names of the two inner classes have to be the same for all enclosing test case classes, and also that we have attached the dimension template argument to the enclosing class rather than to the inner ones, to make further processing simpler. (From a language viewpoint, a namespace would be better to encapsulate these inner classes, rather than a structure. However, namespaces cannot be given as template arguments, so we use a structure to allow a second object to select from within its given argument. The enclosing structure, of course, has no member variables apart from the classes it declares, and a static function to generate the coarse mesh; it will in general never be instantiated.)</p>
<p>The idea is then the following (this is the right time to also take a brief look at the code below): we can generate objects for boundary values and right hand side by simply giving the name of the outer class as a template argument to a class which we call here <code>Data::SetUp</code>, and it then creates objects for the inner classes. In this case, to get all that characterizes the curved ridge solution, we would simply generate an instance of <code>Data::SetUp&lt;Data::CurvedRidge&gt;</code>, and everything we need to know about the solution would be static member variables and functions of that object.</p>
<p>This approach might seem like overkill in this case, but will become very handy once a certain set up is not only characterized by Dirichlet boundary values and a right hand side function, but in addition by material properties, Neumann values, different boundary descriptors, etc. In that case, the <code>SetUp</code> class might consist of a dozen or more objects, and each descriptor class (like the <code>CurvedRidges</code> class below) would have to provide them. Then, you will be happy to be able to change from one set of data to another by only changing the template argument to the <code>SetUp</code> class at one place, rather than at many.</p>
<p>With this framework for different test cases, we are almost finished, but one thing remains: by now we can select statically, by changing one template argument, which data set to choose. In order to be able to do that dynamically, i.e. at run time, we need a base class. This we provide in the obvious way, see below, with virtual abstract functions. It forces us to introduce a second template parameter <code>dim</code> which we need for the base class (which could be avoided using some template magic, but we omit that), but that's all.</p>
<p>Adding new testcases is now simple, you don't have to touch the framework classes, only a structure like the <code>CurvedRidges</code> one is needed.</p>

Since the implementation of the properties of this problem is so particularly simple here, lets do it.

To understand how exactly the mesh is going to look, it may be simplest to just look at the "Results" section of this tutorial program first. In general, if you'd like to understand more about creating meshes either from scratch by hand, as we do here, or using other techniques, you should take a look at <a class="el" href="step_49.html">step-49</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, the example has an extension to 3d, but since this function cannot be written in a dimension independent way we choose not to implement this here, but rather only specialize the template for dim=2. If you compile the program for 3d, you'll get a message from the linker that this function is not implemented for 3d, and needs to be provided.</p>
<p>For the creation of this geometry, the library has no predefined method. In this case, the geometry is still simple enough to do the creation by hand, rather than using a mesh generator.</p>

Here, they are 24 (5 times 5, with the middle one omitted). It is probably best to draw a sketch here.</p>

<p>As you have now read through this framework, you may be wondering why we have not chosen to implement the classes implementing a certain setup (like the <code>CurvedRidges</code> class) directly as classes derived from <code>Data::SetUpBase</code>. Indeed, we could have done very well so. The only reason is that then we would have to have member variables for the solution and right hand side classes in the <code>CurvedRidges</code> class, as well as member functions overloading the abstract functions of the base class giving access to these member variables. The <code>SetUp</code> class has the sole reason to relieve us from the need to reiterate these member variables and functions that would be necessary in all such classes. In some way, the template mechanism here only provides a way to have default implementations for a number of functions that depend on external quantities and can thus not be provided using normal virtual functions, at least not without the help of templates.</p>
<p>However, there might be good reasons to actually implement classes derived from <code>Data::SetUpBase</code>, for example if the solution or right hand side classes require constructors that take arguments, which the <code>Data::SetUpBase</code> class cannot provide. In that case, subclassing is a worthwhile strategy. Other possibilities for special cases are to derive from <code>Data::SetUp&lt;SomeSetUp&gt;</code> where <code>SomeSetUp</code> denotes a class, or even to explicitly specialize <code>Data::SetUp&lt;SomeSetUp&gt;</code>. The latter allows to transparently use the way the <code>SetUp</code> class is used for other set-ups, but with special actions taken for special arguments.</p>
<p>A final observation favoring the approach taken here is the following: we have found numerous times that when starting a project, the number of parameters (usually boundary values, right hand side, coarse grid, just as here) was small, and the number of test cases was small as well. One then starts out by handcoding them into a number of <code>switch</code> statements. Over time, projects grow, and so does the number of test cases. The number of <code>switch</code> statements grows with that, and their length as well, and one starts to find ways to consider impossible examples where domains, boundary values, and right hand sides do not fit together any more, and starts losing the overview over the whole structure. Encapsulating everything belonging to a certain test case into a structure of its own has proven worthwhile for this, as it keeps everything that belongs to one test case in one place. Furthermore, it allows to put these things all in one or more files that are only devoted to test cases and their data, without having to bring their actual implementation into contact with the rest of the program.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Dualfunctionals"></a> </p><h3>Dual functionals</h3>
<p>As with the other components of the program, we put everything we need to describe dual functionals into a namespace of its own, and define an abstract base class that provides the interface the class solving the dual problem needs for its work.</p>
<p>We will then implement two such classes, for the evaluation of a point value and of the derivative of the solution at that point. For these functionals we already have the corresponding evaluation objects, so they are complementary.</p>

<p>First start with the base class for dual functionals. Since for linear problems the characteristics of the dual problem play a role only in the right hand side, we only need to provide for a function that assembles the right hand side for a given discretization:</p>

<p>As a first application, we consider the functional corresponding to the evaluation of the solution's value at a given point which again we assume to be a vertex. Apart from the constructor that takes and stores the evaluation point, this class consists only of the function that implements assembling the right hand side.</p>

Here, J is the evaluation at the point x0, i.e. J(phi_i)=phi_i(x0).</p>
<p>Now, we have assumed that the evaluation point is a vertex. Thus, for the usual finite elements we might be using in this program, we can take for granted that at such a point exactly one shape function is nonzero, and in particular has the value one. Thus, we set the right hand side vector to all-zeros, then seek for the shape function associated with that point and set the corresponding value of the right hand side vector to one:</p>

<p>We could, as in the implementation of the respective evaluation object take the average of the gradients of each shape function phi_i at this evaluation point. However, we take a slightly different approach: we simply take the average over all cells that surround this point. The question which cells <code>surrounds</code> the evaluation point is made dependent on the mesh width by including those cells for which the distance of the cell's midpoint to the evaluation point is less than the cell's diameter.</p>
<p>Taking the average of the gradient over the area/volume of these cells leads to a dual solution which is very close to the one which would result from the point evaluation of the gradient. It is simple to justify theoretically that this does not change the method significantly.</p>

<p>In the same way as the <code>PrimalSolver</code> class above, we now implement a <code>DualSolver</code>. It has all the same features, the only difference is that it does not take a function object denoting a right hand side object, but now takes a <code>DualFunctionalBase</code> object that will assemble the right hand side vector of the dual problem. The rest of the class is rather trivial.</p>
<p>Since both primal and dual solver will use the same triangulation, but different discretizations, it now becomes clear why we have made the <code>Base</code> class a virtual one: since the final class will be derived from both <code>PrimalSolver</code> as well as <code>DualSolver</code>, it would have two <code>Base</code> instances, would we not have marked the inheritance as virtual. Since in many applications the base class would store much more information than just the triangulation which needs to be shared between primal and dual solvers, we do not usually want to use two such base classes.</p>

<p>Here finally comes the main class of this program, the one that implements the dual weighted residual error estimator. It joins the primal and dual solver classes to use them for the computation of primal and dual solutions, and implements the error representation formula for use as error estimate and mesh refinement.</p>
<p>The first few of the functions of this class are mostly overriders of the respective functions of the base class:</p>

These two functions will be called in parallel by the <code>solve_problem</code> function of this class.</p>

<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">using</span> active_cell_iterator =</div><div class="line">  <span class="keyword">typename</span> <a class="code" href="classDoFHandler.html">DoFHandler&lt;dim&gt;::active_cell_iterator</a>;</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Next, declare a data type that we will us to store the contribution of faces to the error estimator. The idea is that we can compute the face terms from each of the two cells to this face, as they are the same when viewed from both sides. What we will do is to compute them only once, based on some rules explained below which of the two adjacent cells will be in charge to do so. We then store the contribution of each face in a map mapping faces to their values, and only collect the contributions for each cell by looping over the cells a second time and grabbing the values from the map.</p>
<p>The data type of this map is declared here:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">using</span> FaceIntegrals =</div><div class="line">  <span class="keyword">typename</span> std::map&lt;typename DoFHandler&lt;dim&gt;::face_iterator, <span class="keywordtype">double</span>&gt;;</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>In the computation of the error estimates on cells and faces, we need a number of helper objects, such as <code><a class="el" href="classFEValues.html">FEValues</a></code> and <code><a class="el" href="classFEFaceValues.html">FEFaceValues</a></code> functions, but also temporary objects storing the values and gradients of primal and dual solutions, for example. These fields are needed in the three functions that do the integration on cells, and regular and irregular faces, respectively.</p>
<p>There are three reasonable ways to provide these fields: first, as local variables in the function that needs them; second, as member variables of this class; third, as arguments passed to that function.</p>
<p>These three alternatives all have drawbacks: the third that their number is not negligible and would make calling these functions a lengthy enterprise. The second has the drawback that it disallows parallelization, since the threads that will compute the error estimate have to have their own copies of these variables each, so member variables of the enclosing class will not work. The first approach, although straightforward, has a subtle but important drawback: we will call these functions over and over again, many thousands of times maybe; it now turns out that allocating vectors and other objects that need memory from the heap is an expensive business in terms of run-time, since memory allocation is expensive when several threads are involved. It is thus significantly better to allocate the memory only once, and recycle the objects as often as possible.</p>
<p>What to do? Our answer is to use a variant of the third strategy. In fact, this is exactly what the <a class="el" href="namespaceWorkStream.html">WorkStream</a> concept is supposed to do (we have already introduced it above, but see also <a class="el" href="group__threads.html">Parallel computing with multiple processors accessing</a>). To avoid that we have to give these functions a dozen or so arguments, we pack all these variables into two structures, one which is used for the computations on cells, the other doing them on the faces. Both are then joined into the WeightedResidualScratchData class that will serve as the "scratch data" class of the <a class="el" href="namespaceWorkStream.html">WorkStream</a> concept:</p>

<p>As for the actual computation of error estimates, let's start with the function that drives all this, i.e. calls those functions that actually do the work, and finally collects the results.</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">template</span> &lt;<span class="keywordtype">int</span> dim&gt;</div><div class="line"><span class="keywordtype">void</span></div><div class="line">WeightedResidual&lt;dim&gt;::estimate_error(<a class="code" href="classVector.html">Vector&lt;float&gt;</a> &amp;error_indicators)<span class="keyword"> const</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword"></span>{</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>The first task in computing the error is to set up vectors that denote the primal solution, and the weights (z-z_h)=(z-I_hz), both in the finite element space for which we have computed the dual solution. For this, we have to interpolate the primal solution to the dual finite element space, and to subtract the interpolation of the computed dual solution to the primal finite element space. Fortunately, the library provides functions for the interpolation into larger or smaller finite element spaces, so this is mostly obvious.</p>
<p>First, let's do that for the primal solution: it is cell-wise interpolated into the finite element space in which we have solved the dual problem: But, again as in the <code>WeightedResidual::output_solution</code> function we first need to create an <a class="el" href="classAffineConstraints.html">AffineConstraints</a> object including the hanging node constraints, but this time of the dual finite element space.</p>

We leave the optimization of the program in this respect as an exercise.</p>
<p>Having computed the dual weights we now proceed with computing the cell and face residuals of the primal solution. First we set up a map between face iterators and their jump term contributions of faces to the error estimator. The reason is that we compute the jump terms only once, from one side of the face, and want to collect them only afterwards when looping over all cells a second time.</p>
<p>We initialize this map already with a value of -1e20 for all faces, since this value will stand out in the results if something should go wrong and we fail to compute the value for a face for some reason. Secondly, this initialization already makes the std::map object allocate all objects it may possibly need. This is important since we will write into this structure from parallel threads, and doing so would not be thread-safe if the map needed to allocate memory and thereby reshape its data structures. In other words, the initial initialization relieves us from the necessity to synchronize the threads through a mutex each time they write to (and modify the structure of) this map.</p>

<p>You will have noted that this program is built up of a number of small parts (evaluation functions, solver classes implementing various refinement methods, different dual functionals, different problem and data descriptions), which makes the program relatively simple to extend, but also allows to solve a large number of different problems by replacing one part by another.

<p>请注意解决角部奇异点和解决评估点周围的奇异点之间的微妙相互作用。手工生成这样的网格是相当困难的，因为这将涉及到定量地判断四个角的奇异点应该被解决多少，并设置与评估点附近的权重。</p>
<p>程序会打印出这个数量的点值和估计的误差。通过推断，我们可以猜测出精确的数值接近0.0334473，正负0.0000001（注意，我们从只有22000个（原始）自由度中得到近6个有效数字。这个数字不能单独从函数值中得到，但我使用了误差估计器大部分是精确的假设，并将计算值加上估计误差进行外推，得到真实值的近似值。用更多自由度的计算表明，这个假设确实是有效的。</p>
<p>从计算结果中，我们可以生成两个图表：一个显示点值中误差 \(J(u)-J(u_h)\) （将外推值视为正确）的收敛性，以及我们将计算值 \(J(u_h)\) 和估计误差eta相加得到的值（如果误差估计器 \(eta\) 是精确的，那么值 \(J(u_h)+\eta\) 将等于精确的点值，并且这个量的误差将总是零；然而，由于误差估计器只是对真实误差的一个-好的-近似值，我们只能通过这个来减少误差的大小）。)在这张图中，我们还指出了复杂度 \({\cal O}(1/N)\) ，以表明网格细化在这种情况下的作用是最佳的。第二张图比较了真实误差和估计误差，显示两者实际上是非常接近的，即使对于点值这样一个复杂的数量。</p>

<p>由于我们在使用由对偶加权误差估计器驱动的网格细化时接受了相当多的努力（用于解决对偶问题，以及评估误差表示），因此值得询问这种努力是否成功。为此，我们首先比较不同的网格细化标准所达到的误差水平。要产生这些数据，只需改变主程序中的网格细化准则变量的值。结果是这样的（对于Kelly指标中的权重，我们选择了 \(1/(r^2+0.1^2)\) 这个函数，其中 \(r\) 是到评估点的距离；可以证明，如果我们忽略边界的影响，这就是最佳权重）。</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="https://www.dealii.org/images/steps/developer/step-14.point-value.error-comparison.png"/>
</div>
<p>检查这些数字，我们看到对于全局细化，误差与 \(O(1/(sqrt(N) log(N)))\) 成正比，而对于双重估计器 \(O(1/N)\) 。一般来说，我们看到双重加权误差估计器比其他细化指标要好，至少在与那些具有类似规则行为的指标相比时是如此。凯利指标产生的误差较小，但在画面上的跳动相当不规则，误差有时也会改变符号。因此，它的行为不允许将结果推断到更大的N值。此外，如果我们相信双重加权误差估计器的误差估计值，可以通过将估计的误差加入到计算值中来改善结果。因此在可靠性方面，加权估计器比凯利指标更好，尽管后者有时会产生较小的误差。</p>

<p>除了评估某一点上的解的值，程序还提供了评估某一点上的X-导数的可能性，并且还可以为此定制网格细化的方法。要让程序计算这些量，只需将主函数中出现的两个 <code>PointValueEvaluation</code> 替换为 <code>PointXDerivativeEvaluation</code> ，然后让程序运行。</p>

<p>请注意，与我们在点评估中获得的网格相比，这些网格是不对称的。这是由于域和原始解可能是围绕对角线对称的，但 \(x\) -导数不是，后者进入了细化标准。</p>
<p>然后，有趣的是，将感兴趣的量的实际计算值（即在某一点的解决方案的X导数）与参考值-0.0528223...正负0.0000005进行比较。我们通过在更细的网格上计算得到这个参考值，经过一些更细的网格细化，大约有13万个单元。回顾一下，如果在最佳情况下，误差是 \(O(1/N)\) ，那么采用多十倍的单元格的网格，我们的结果就会多出一个数字。</p>

<p>如果我们不选择 <code>Exercise_2_3</code> 的数据集，而是在主函数中选择 <code>CurvedRidges</code> ，并选择 \((0.5,0.5)\) 作为评价点，那么我们就可以重新进行前面的例子程序的计算，以比较在双重加权误差估计器帮助下得到的结果是否比之前的结果更好。</p>

<p>在网格中仍然可以看到解的特征，但是由于解是光滑的，对偶解的奇异点完全主导了网格细化准则，并导致网格强烈集中。第七次细化步骤后的解看起来像下面这样。</p>

<p>显然，在某些地方的解是比较差的，但是网格细化过程中应该注意到这些地方对计算点值并不重要。</p>
<p>下一步是将新的（基于二重性的）网格细化标准与旧的标准进行比较。这些是结果。</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="https://www.dealii.org/images/steps/developer/step-14.step-13.error-comparison.png"/>
</div>
<p>其结果是，嗯，有点混合。首先，Kelly指标因其不稳定的行为而失去了资格，多次改变了误差的符号，而且在网格细化下误差越来越大。双重加权误差估计器的误差呈单调下降，比加权凯利和全局细化要好，但幅度没有预期的那么大。在这里，这是由于全局细化可以利用评估点周围网格的规则结构，从而导致点误差的收敛顺序更好。然而，如果我们有一个不是局部矩形的网格，例如因为我们必须近似弯曲的边界，或者如果系数不是恒定的，那么全局细化网格的这种优势就会消失，而基于对偶性的估计器的良好性能将保持不变。</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="Conclusionsandoutlook"></a></p><h3>Conclusions and outlook</h3>
<p>这里的结果并没有太明显地表明双加权误差估计方法在网格细化方面比其他网格细化标准（如Kelly指标）更有优势。这是由于所显示的应用相对简单的缘故。如果你还不相信这种方法确实有优势，请你浏览一下引言中提到的文献，其中提供了大量的例子，双加权方法可以将必要的数值工作减少几个数量级，使之成为计算某些数量的合理精度的唯一途径。</p>
<p>除了你可能对其作为网格细化标准提出的反对意见外，考虑到对可能想要计算的量的误差的准确认识是非常有用的，因为我们可以在对精度满意的时候停止计算。使用更传统的方法，很难得到任意量的精确估计，也许除了能量准则的误差，我们将不能保证我们计算的结果满足对其准确性的任何要求。另外，正如对点值和导数的评价所显示的那样，误差估计可以用来推断结果，在我们想知道的量上产生更高的精度。</p>
<p>抛开这些数学上的考虑，我们试图以模块化的方式编写程序，这样实现另一个测试案例，或另一个评估和双重功能就很简单。我们鼓励你把这个程序作为你自己实验的基础，并且玩一玩。</p>
