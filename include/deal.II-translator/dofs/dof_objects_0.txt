[0.x.0]*
     Store the indices of the degrees of freedom which are located on     objects of dimension  [2.x.0]          [1.x.0]         The DoFObjects classes store the global indices of the degrees of     freedom for each cell on a certain level. The global index or number of     a degree of freedom is the zero-based index of the according value in     the solution vector and the row and column index in the global matrix     or the multigrid matrix for this level. These indices refer to the     unconstrained vectors and matrices, where we have not taken account of     the constraints introduced by hanging nodes.         Since vertices are not associated with a particular level, the indices     associated with vertices are not stored in the DoFObjects classes but     rather in the  [2.x.1]  array.         The DoFObjects classes are not used directly, but objects of these     classes are included in the DoFLevel and DoFFaces classes.        
*  [2.x.2]     
* [0.x.1]*
       Store the global indices of the degrees of freedom.      
* [0.x.2]*
       Set the global index of the  [2.x.3]  degree of freedom       located on the object with number  [2.x.4]  to the value given by       the last argument. The  [2.x.5]  argument is used to access the       finite element that is to be used to compute the location where this       data is stored.             The third argument,  [2.x.6]  must equal zero. It is otherwise       unused, but we retain the argument so that we can use the same       interface for non-hp- and hp-finite element methods, in effect making       it possible to share the DoFAccessor class hierarchy between hp- and       non-hp-classes.      
* [0.x.3]*
       Return the global index of the  [2.x.7]  degree of freedom       located on the object with number  [2.x.8]  The  [2.x.9]        argument is used to access the finite element that is to be used to       compute the location where this data is stored.             The third argument,  [2.x.10]  must equal zero. It is otherwise       unused, but we retain the argument so that we can use the same       interface for non-hp- and hp-finite element methods, in effect making       it possible to share the DoFAccessor class hierarchy between hp- and       non-hp-classes.      
* [0.x.4]*
       Return the value 1. The meaning of this function becomes clear by       looking at what the corresponding functions in the classes        [2.x.11]       
* [0.x.5]*
       Similar to the function above. Assert that the given index is zero,       and then return true.      
* [0.x.6]*
       Determine an estimate for the memory consumption (in bytes) of this       object.      
* [0.x.7]*
       Read or write the data of this object to or from a stream for the       purpose of serialization using the [BOOST serialization       library](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_74_0/libs/serialization/doc/index.html).
