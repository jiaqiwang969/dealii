*  Simplex and mixed meshes in deal.II are still experimental, i.e., work in progress. Large parts of the library have been ported to be able to operate on such kind of meshes. However, there are still many functions that need to be generalized. You can get a good overview of the ported functionalities by taking a look at the tests in the folder "tests/simplex". In the following, we provide two very basic examples to get started and provide some implementation details.
* 

* 
*  [2.x.2]  simplex_reference_example_simplex Example: simplex mesh
*  The following code shows how to work with simplex meshes:
*   [2.x.3] 
* 

* 
*  [2.x.4]  simplex_reference_example_mixed Example: mixed mesh
*  The following code shows how to work with mixed meshes:
*   [2.x.5] 
* 

* 
*  [2.x.6]  simplex_reference_cells Reference cells
*  In 2D, we provide triangles and quadrilaterals with the following possible orientations in 3D:
*   [2.x.7]       [2.x.8]    </div>    [2.x.9]       [2.x.10]    </div> </div>
*  In 3D, tetrahedra, pyramids, wedges, and hexahedra are available:
*     [2.x.11]       [2.x.12]    </div>
*     [2.x.13]       [2.x.14]    </div>
*     [2.x.15]       [2.x.16]    </div>
*     [2.x.17]       [2.x.18]    </div>
*  Each surface of a 3D reference cell consists of 2D reference cells. The documentation of the enumeration of the numbering of their vertices and lines are given in the right columns.
