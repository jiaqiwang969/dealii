*  The classes in this module are wrappers around functionality provided by the Trilinos library. They provide a modern object-oriented interface that is compatible with the interfaces of the other linear algebra classes in deal.II. All classes and functions in this group reside in a namespace  [2.x.1] 
*  These classes are only available if a Trilinos installation was detected during configuration of deal.II. Refer to the README file for more details about this.
