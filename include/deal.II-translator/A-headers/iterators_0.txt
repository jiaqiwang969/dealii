*  [2.x.0]   [2.x.1] 
* deal.II has several classes which are understood conceptually asmeshes. Apart from the obvious Triangulation, these are, for example,DoFHandler and  [2.x.2]  All of those define a setof iterators, allowing the user to traverse the whole mesh, i.e. theset of cells, faces, edges, etc that comprise the mesh, or portions ofit. These iterators are all in a sense derived from the TriaIteratorclass.
* Basically, the template signature of TriaIterator is
* [1.x.0]
* 
* Conceptually, this type represents something like a pointer to an objectrepresented by the  [2.x.3]  class.  Usually, you will not use theactual class names spelled out directly, but employ one of the typedefsprovided by the mesh classes, such as <code>typename [2.x.4]  Before going into this, let usfirst discuss the concept of iterators, before delving into what the accessorsdo.
* As usual in C++, iterators, just as pointers, are incremented to the nextelement using <tt>operator ++</tt>, and decremented to the previous elementusing <tt>operator
* 
*  - </tt>. One can also jump <tt>n</tt> elements ahead usingthe addition operator, <tt>it=it+n</tt>, and correspondingly to move a numberof elements back. In addition, and keeping with the tradition of the standardtemplate library, meshes provide member functions <tt>begin()</tt> and<tt>end()</tt> that provide the first element of a collection and aone-past-the-end iterator, respectively. Since there are a number of differentiterators available, there is actually a whole family of such functions, suchas <tt>begin_active()</tt>, <tt>begin_face()</tt>, etc.
* In terms of the concepts for iterators defined in the C++ standard, thedeal.II mesh iterators are bi-directional iterators: they can be incrementedand decremented, but an operation like <tt>it=it+n</tt> takes a compute timeproportional to <tt>n</tt>, since it is implemented as a sequence of<tt>n</tt> individual unit increments. Note that this is in contrast to thenext more specialized iterator concept, random access iterators, for whichaccess to an arbitrary object requires only constant time, rather than linear.
* 

* 
*  [2.x.5]  IteratorsAndSets Iterators as pointers into sets of objects
* As mentioned above, iterators in deal.II can be considered as iterating overall the objects that constitute a mesh. (These objects are lines, quads, andhexes, and are represented by the type of Accessor class given as template argument to the iterator.) This suggests to view a triangulation as acollection of cells and other objects that are held together by a certain datastructure that links all these objects, in the same was as a linked list isthe data structure that connects objects in a linear fashion.
* Triangulations in deal.II can indeed be considered in this way. In particular,they use the computational notion of a forest of regular trees to store theirdata. This can be understood as follows: Consider the cells of the coarse meshas roots; then, if one of these coarse mesh cells is refined, it will have2<sup>dim</sup> children, which in turn can, but do not have to have2<sup>dim</sup> children of their own, and so on. This means, that each cellof the coarse mesh can be considered the root of a binary tree (in 1d), aquadtree (in 2d), or an octree (in 3d). The collection of these treesemanating from the cells of the coarse mesh then constitutes the forest thatcompletely describes the triangulation, including all of its active andinactive cells. In particular, the active cells are those terminal nodes inthe tree that have no descendants, i.e. cells which are not furtherrefined. Correspondingly, inactive cells correspond to nodes in the tree withdescendants, i.e. cells that are further refined.
* A triangulation contains forests for lines (each of which may have 2children), quads (each with possibly four children), and hexes (each with noor 8 children). Depending on the dimension, these objects are also termedcells or faces.
* Iterators loop over the elements of such forests. While the usual iteratorsloop over all nodes of a forest, active iterators iterate over theelements in the same order, but skip all non-active entries and therefore onlyvisit terminal nodes (i.e. active cells, faces, etc). There are many ways totraverse the elements of a forest, for example breadth first or depthfirst. Depending on the type of data structure used to store the forest, someways are more efficient than others. At present, the way iterators traverseforests in deal.II is breadth first. I.e., iterators first visit all theelements (cells, faces, etc) of the coarse mesh before moving on to all theelements of the immediate level, i.e. the immediate children of the coarsemesh objects; after this come the grandchildren of the coarse mesh, and so on.However, it must be noted that programs should not rely on this particularorder of traversing a tree: this is considered an implementation detail thatcan change between versions, even if we consider this an unlikely option atthe present time.

* 
*  [2.x.6]  IteratorsDifferences Different kinds of iterators
* Iterators have two properties: what they point to (i.e. the type of theAccessor template argument), and the exact definition of the set they iterateover. In general, iterators are always declared as
* [1.x.1]
* 
* Here, <tt>Kind</tt> determines what property an accessor needs to have to bereached by this iterator (or omitted, for that matter). For example,
* [1.x.2]
* iterates over all objects of kind Accessor that make up the mesh (for exampleall cells, whether they are further refined and have children, or not), whereas
* [1.x.3]
* skips all objects that have children, i.e. objects that are not active.Active iterators therefore operate on a subset of the objectsthat normal iterators act on, namely those that possess the property thatthey are active. Note that this is independent of the kind of object weare operating on: all valid accessor classes have to provide the iteratorclasses a method to find out whether they are active or not.
* (For completeness, let us mention that there is a third kind of iterators: "rawiterators" also traverse objects that are unused in the triangulation, butallocated anyway for efficiency reasons. User code should never use rawiterators, they are only for %internal purposes of the library.)
* Whether an object is active can be considered a "predicate": a property thatis either true or false. Filtered iterators can be used to restrict the scopeof existing iterators even more. For instance, you could imagine to iterateover the subset of those  [2.x.7]  "active cells" having their userflag set or belonging to a certain subdomain (both properties are either trueor false for a given object).
* This is achieved by using an object of type FilteredIterator&lt;BaseIterator&gt;, where BaseIterator usually is one of thestandard iterators discussed above.
* The FilteredIterator gets an additional Predicate in its constructor and willskip all objects where this Predicate evaluates to <tt>false</tt>. Acollection of predicates already implemented can be found in the namespaceIteratorFilters.
* 

* 
*  [2.x.8]  IteratorsLoops Iterating over objects
* All iterators of the same kind and iterating over thesame kind of geometrical objects traverse the mesh in the sameorder. Take this code example:
* [1.x.4]
* 
* Here, all iterators will always point to the same mesh cell, even though<tt>DoFHandler</tt> and <tt>Triangulation</tt> are very different classes,and even if the DoFHandlers are handling different finite elements: theyall access cells in the same order, the difference is only in the Accessor.As mentioned above, the order in which iterators traverse the forest ofobjects is actually well-defined, but application programs should notassume any such order, but rather consider this an implementation detailof the library.
* Corresponding to above example, the order in which iterators traverse activeobjects is the same for all iterators in the following snippet, the difference to the previous example being that here we only consider active cells:
* [1.x.5]

* 
*  [2.x.9]  IteratorsAccessors Accessors
* Iterators are like pointers: they can be incremented and decremented, but theyare really rather dumb. Their magic only lies in the fact that they point tosome useful object, in this case the Accessor. For pointers, they point to anactual object that stores some data. On the other hand, the deal.II iterators,when dereferenced, do not return a reference to an actual object, but returnan object that knows how to get at the data that represents cells. In general, thisobject doesn't store itself where the vertices of a cell are or what its neighborsare. However, it knows how to tease this sort of information from out of thearrays and tables and lists that the Triangulation class sets up to describe amesh.
* Accessing data that characterizes a cell is always done through the Accessor,i.e. the expression  [2.x.10]  grants access to [1.x.6]attributes of this Accessor. Examples of properties you can query from aniterator are
* [1.x.7]
* 
* Since dereferencing iterators yields accessor objects, these calls are tomember functions  [2.x.11] , [2.x.12]  etc. These in turn figure out the relevant datafrom the various data structures that store this data. How this is actuallydone and what data structures are used is not really of concern to authors ofapplications in deal.II. In particular, by hiding the actual data structureswe are able to store data in an efficient way, not necessarily in a way thatmakes it easily accessible or understandable to application writers.
* 

* 
*  [2.x.13]  IteratorsTypedefs Kinds of accessors
* Depending on what sort of data you want to access, there are different kindsof accessor classes:
* 
*  - The TriaAccessor class provides you with data that identifies the geometric  properties of cells, faces, lines, quads, and hexes that make up a  triangulation, as well as parent-child relationships.
* 
*  - The CellAccessor class is derived from the TriaAccessor class for cases  where an object has full dimension, i.e. is a cell rather than for example a  line bounding a cell. In that case, additional information about the  topological connection of a mesh is available from an accessor such as to  request iterators pointing to neighbors of a cell.
* 
*  - The DoFAccessor class lets you access information related to degrees  of freedom associated with cells, faces, etc; it does so for both  DoFHandler and  [2.x.14]  objects. Note that the DoFAccessor  class is derived from either TriaAccessor or CellAccessor (depending  on whether the DoFAccessor points to an object of full dimension or  not) and so is able to provide a superset of information over its  base classes. Additionally, the DoFAccessor class comes in two  flavors, one accessing degrees of freedom on the level of a cell and  the other accessing the active dofs of an active cell.
* 
*  - The DoFCellAccessor class has the same purpose and relation to  DoFCellAccessor as the CellAccessor has to TriaAccessor.
* Except to look up member documentation, you will not usually have to deal withthe actual class names listed above. Rather, one uses the typedefs provided bythe mesh classes Triangulation, DoFHandler and  [2.x.15]  as wellas the function that generate such objects:
* <table border=1>  <tr>    <th>Class</th>    <th>cell_iterator type</th>    <th>function call</th>  </tr>  <tr>    <th>Triangulation</th>    <td>typename  [2.x.16]      [2.x.17]   </tr>  <tr>    <th>DoFHandler</th>    <td>typename  [2.x.18]      [2.x.19]   </tr>  <tr>     [2.x.20]     <td>typename  [2.x.21]      [2.x.22]   </tr></table>
* The Triangulation class supports iterating across cell faces with <tt>typename [2.x.23]  which is the type returned by [2.x.24] 
* Active iterators have the following properties:
* <table border=1>  <tr>    <th>Class</th>    <th>cell_iterator type</th>    <th>function call</th>  </tr>  <tr>    <th>Triangulation</th>    <td>typename  [2.x.25]      [2.x.26]   </tr>  <tr>    <th>DoFHandler</th>    <td>typename  [2.x.27]      [2.x.28]   </tr>  <tr>     [2.x.29]     <td>typename  [2.x.30]      [2.x.31]   </tr></table>
* The Triangulation class also supports iterating across active cell faces with<tt>typename  [2.x.32]  which is the type returned by [2.x.33] 
* In addition to these types and calls that act on cells and faces (logicalconcepts that depend on the dimension: a cell is a quadrilateral in 2d, buta hexahedron in 3d), there are corresponding types and calls like [2.x.34]  that act on thedimension independent geometric objects line, quad, and hex. These calls,just as the ones above, exist in active and non-active forms.
* The actual definition of all the typedefs local to the mesh classes arestated in the
* 
*  -  [2.x.35]    [2.x.36]  and   [2.x.37]  classes for Triangulation  iterators,
* 
*  - [1.x.8], [1.x.9], and [1.x.10] classes for DoFHandler and  [2.x.38]  iterators.
*  [2.x.39]  IteratorAccessorInternals Iterator and accessor internals
* Iterators, being like pointers, act as if they pointed to an actualobject, but in reality all they do is to return an accessor whendereferenced. The accessor object contains the state, i.e. it knowswhich object it represents, by storing for example which Triangulationit belongs to, and the level and index within this level of a cell. Itis therefore able to access the data that corresponds to the cell (orface, or edge) it represents
* There is a representation of past-the-end-pointers, denoted by specialvalues of the member variables  [2.x.40]  inthe TriaAccessor class: If  [2.x.41]   [2.x.42]  =0,then the object is valid; if [2.x.43] ==-1, then the iterator pointspast the end; in all other cases, the iterator is considered invalid.You can check this by calling the  [2.x.44]  function.
* Past-the-end iterators may also be used to compare an iterator withthe before-the-start value, when running backwards. There is nodistinction between the iterators pointing past the two ends of avector.
* Cells are stored based on a hierarchical structure of levels, therefore theabove mentioned structure is useful. Faces however are not organized inlevels, and accessors for objects of lower dimensionality do not have a [2.x.45]  member variable.
