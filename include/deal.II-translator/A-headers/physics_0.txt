   Notations that reduce the order of tensors, effectively storing them in some   sort of consistent compressed storage pattern. An example is storing the   6 independent components of  [2.x.2]  symmetric tensors of rank 2 as a   vector with 6 components, and then representing the 36 independent elements   of symmetric  [2.x.3]  tensors of rank 4 (which when   applied to a symmetric rank-2 tensor yields another symmetric rank-2 tensor)   as a  [2.x.4]  matrix.     Although this method of representing tensors is most regularly associated with   the efficient storage of the fourth-order elasticity tensor, with its   generalization it has wider applicability. This representation is also common   in the physics, material science and FEM literature.     There are several variations of tensor notation, each a slightly different   structure. The primary difference between the various forms of tensor notation   is the weighting prescribed to the various elements of the compressed tensors.   This [1.x.0] has   some further general insights on this topic.

  A collection of operations to assist in the transformation of tensor  quantities from the reference to spatial configuration, and vice versa.  These types of transformation are typically used to re-express quantities  measured or computed in one configuration in terms of a second configuration.

*   We will use the same notation for the coordinates  [2.x.7] ,  transformations  [2.x.8] , differential operator  [2.x.9]  and deformation  gradient  [2.x.10]  as discussed for namespace  [2.x.11] 
*   As a further point on notation, we will follow Holzapfel (2007) and denote  the push forward transformation as  [2.x.12]  and  the pull back transformation as  [2.x.13] .  We will also use the annotation  [2.x.14]  to indicate  that a tensor  [2.x.15]  is a contravariant tensor,  and  [2.x.16]  that it is covariant. In other  words, these indices do not actually change the tensor, they just indicate  the [1.x.2] of object a particular tensor is.
*  
*  [2.x.17]  For these transformations, unless otherwise stated, we will strictly  assume that all indices of the transformed tensors derive from one coordinate  system; that is to say that they are not multi-point tensors (such as the  Piola stress in elasticity).

   This namespace provides a collection of definitions that   conform to standard notation used in (nonlinear) elasticity.     [1.x.3]     References for this notation include:

*      For convenience we will predefine some commonly referenced tensors and   operations.   Considering the position vector  [2.x.20]  in the referential (material)   configuration, points  [2.x.21]  are transformed to points  [2.x.22]    in the current (spatial) configuration through the nonlinear map   [1.x.5]   where the  [2.x.23]  represents the displacement vector.   From this we can compute the deformation gradient tensor as   [1.x.6]   wherein the differential operator  [2.x.24]  is defined as    [2.x.25]  and  [2.x.26]  is the identity   tensor.     Finally, two common tensor operators are represented by  [2.x.27]  and  [2.x.28]    operators. These respectively represent a single and double contraction over   the inner tensor indices.   Vectors and second-order tensors are highlighted by bold font, while   fourth-order tensors are denoted by calliagraphic font.     One can think of fourth-order tensors as linear operators mapping second-order   tensors (matrices) onto themselves in much the same way as matrices map   vectors onto vectors.   To provide some context to the implemented class members and functions,   consider the following fundamental operations performed on tensors with special   properties:     If we represent a general second-order tensor as  [2.x.29] , then the general   fourth-order unit tensors  [2.x.30]  and  [2.x.31]  are   defined by   [1.x.7]   or, in indicial notation,   [1.x.8]   with the Kronecker deltas taking their common definition.   Note that  [2.x.32] .     We then define the symmetric and skew-symmetric fourth-order unit tensors by   [1.x.9]   such that   [1.x.10]   The fourth-order symmetric tensor returned by identity_tensor() is    [2.x.33] .
