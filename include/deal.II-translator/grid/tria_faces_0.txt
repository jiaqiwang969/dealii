[0.x.0]*
     This class contains information belonging to the faces of a     triangulation. These classes are similar to the TriaLevel classes. As     cells are organised in a hierarchical structure of levels, each     triangulation consists of several such TriaLevels. However the faces of     a triangulation, lower dimensional objects like lines in 2D or lines     and quads in 3D, do not have to be based on such a hierarchical     structure. In fact we have to organise them in only one object if we     want to enable anisotropic refinement. Therefore the TriaFaces classes     store the information belonging to the faces of a triangulation     separately from the TriaLevel classes.
