[0.x.0]*
 Class implementing the integrated Legendre polynomials described in the PhD thesis of Sabine Zaglmayr.
*  This class was written based upon the existing deal.II Legendre class as a base, but with the coefficients adjusted so that the recursive formula is for the integrated Legendre polynomials described in the PhD thesis of Sabine Zaglmayr. The polynomials can be generated recursively from:
* 

* 
* 
*  -  [2.x.0]  (added so that it can be generated recursively from 0)
* 

* 
* 
*  -  [2.x.1] 
* 

* 
* 
*  -  [2.x.2] 
* 

* 
* 
*  -  [2.x.3] .
*  However, it is also possible to generate them directly from the Legendre polynomials:
*   [2.x.4] 

* 
* [0.x.1]*
   Constructor generating the coefficients of the polynomials at degree p.  
* [0.x.2]*
   Return the complete set of Integrated Legendre polynomials up to the   given degree.  
* [0.x.3]*
   Main function to compute the co-efficients of the polynomial at degree p.  
* [0.x.4]
