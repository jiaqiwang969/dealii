[0.x.0]*
   Data structure  
* [0.x.1]*
     Copy the active data (values for Host and values_dev for CUDA) to  [2.x.0]      If the data is on the device it is moved to the host.    
* [0.x.2]*
     Copy the data in  [2.x.1]  to the active data of the structure (values for     Host and values_dev for CUDA). The pointer  [2.x.2]  must be on the host.    
* [0.x.3]*
     Pointer to data on the host.    
* [0.x.4]*
     Pointer to data on the device.    
* [0.x.5]*
     Pointers to the data of the processes sharing the same memory.    
* [0.x.6]*
   Swap function similar to  [2.x.3]   
* [0.x.7]*
     This is currently not used.
