[0.x.0]*
 This class generates graphical output for BoundingBox objects, starting from any object that can be converted by boost to a BoundingBox.

* 
* [0.x.1]*
   Constructor.  
* [0.x.2]*
   Destructor.  
* [0.x.3]*
   Generate patches from a range of objects that can be converted by boost to   a collection of BoundingBox objects.     You could pass to this function iterators to BoundingBox objects, or to   pairs or tuples in which the first element is a BoundingBox object.  
* [0.x.4]*
   Generate patches from a container of objects that can be converted by boost   to a collection of BoundingBox objects.     You could pass to this function a container of BoundingBox objects, or a   container of pairs or tuples in which the first element is a BoundingBox   object.  
* [0.x.5]*
   Attach data to each output patch that was generated by build_patches().     The  [2.x.0]  parameter is expected to have the same size of the   container you used in the call to build_patches(), and each entry should   have the same size of the  [2.x.1]  argument.      [2.x.2]  datasets The actual data to attach to each patch    [2.x.3]  dataset_names The name of each component of the dataset  
* [0.x.6]*
   The actual boxes.  
* [0.x.7]*
   Names of datasets.  
* [0.x.8]
