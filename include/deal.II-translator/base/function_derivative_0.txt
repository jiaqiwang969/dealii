[0.x.0]*
 Derivative of a function object.  The value access functions of this class return the directional derivative of a function with respect to a direction provided on construction. If <tt>b</tt> is the vector, the derivative <tt>b . grad f</tt> is computed. This derivative is evaluated directly, not by computing the gradient of <tt>f</tt> and its scalar product with <tt>b</tt>.
*  The derivative is computed numerically, using one of the provided difference formulas (see <tt>set_formula</tt> for available schemes). Experimenting with <tt>h</tt> and the difference scheme may be necessary to obtain sufficient results.

*  [2.x.0]

* [0.x.1]*
   Constructor. Provided are the functions to compute derivatives of, the   direction vector of the differentiation and the step size <tt>h</tt> of   the difference formula.  
* [0.x.2]*
   Constructor. Provided are the functions to compute derivatives of and the   direction vector of the differentiation in each quadrature point and the   difference step size.     This is the constructor for a variable velocity field. Most probably, a   new object of <tt>FunctionDerivative</tt> has to be constructed for each   set of quadrature points.     The number of quadrature point must still be the same, when values are   accessed.  
* [0.x.3]*
   Choose the difference formula. This is set to the default in the   constructor.     Formulas implemented right now are first order backward Euler   (<tt>UpwindEuler</tt>), second order symmetric Euler (<tt>Euler</tt>) and   a symmetric fourth order formula (<tt>FourthOrder</tt>).  
* [0.x.4]*
   Change the base step size of the difference formula  
* [0.x.5]*
   Return an estimate for the memory consumption, in bytes, of this object.   This is not exact (but will usually be close) because calculating the   memory usage of trees (e.g.,  [2.x.1]  is difficult.  
* [0.x.6]*
   Function for differentiation.  
* [0.x.7]*
   Step size of the difference formula.  
* [0.x.8]*
   Difference formula.  
* [0.x.9]*
   Helper object. Contains the increment vector for the formula.  
* [0.x.10]
