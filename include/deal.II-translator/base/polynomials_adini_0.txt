[0.x.0]*
 The cubic polynomial space for the Adini element
*  This space consists of the cubic space [1.x.0] augmented by the functions [1.x.1] and [1.x.2].
*  The basis of the space is chosen to match the node functionals of the Adini element.
*   [2.x.0]  This polynomial space is implemented in 2D only and does not compute derivatives of order 3 or higher.

* [0.x.1]*
   Constructor for the polynomials of the described space  
* [0.x.2]*
   Compute the value and the first and second derivatives of each   polynomial at <tt>unit_point</tt>.     The size of the vectors must either be equal 0 or equal n(). In the first   case, the function will not compute these values, i.e. you indicate what   you want to have computed by resizing those vectors which you want   filled.     If you need values or derivatives of all polynomials then use this   function, rather than using any of the compute_value(), compute_grad() or   compute_grad_grad() functions, see below, in a loop over all polynomials.  
* [0.x.3]*
   Compute the value of the <tt>i</tt>th polynomial at <tt>unit_point</tt>.     Consider using evaluate() instead.

* [0.x.8]*
   Compute the gradient of the <tt>i</tt>th polynomial at   <tt>unit_point</tt>.     Consider using evaluate() instead.  
* [0.x.9]*
   Compute the second derivative (grad_grad) of the <tt>i</tt>th polynomial   at <tt>unit_point</tt>.     Consider using evaluate() instead.
