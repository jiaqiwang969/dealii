[0.x.0]*
   Namespace for the flags for point_values() and point_gradients().  
* [0.x.1]*
     Flags for point_values() and point_gradients().    
* [0.x.2]*
       Compute average.      
* [0.x.3]*
       Compute maximum.            
*  [2.x.0]  Only available for scalar values.      
* [0.x.4]*
       Compute minimum.            
*  [2.x.1]  Only available for scalar values.      
* [0.x.5]*
       Take any value.      
* [0.x.6]*
   Given a (distributed) solution vector  [2.x.2]  evaluate the values at   the (arbitrary and even remote) points specified by  [2.x.3]       [2.x.4]  This is a collective call that needs to be executed by all     processors in the communicator.  
* [0.x.7]*
   Given a (distributed) solution vector  [2.x.5]  evaluate the values at   the points specified by  [2.x.6]  which might have been set up by the   above function.    
*  [2.x.7]  Refinement/coarsening/repartitioning leads to the invalidation of the     cache so that the above function has to be called again.      [2.x.8]  This is a collective call that needs to be executed by all     processors in the communicator.  
* [0.x.8]*
   Given a (distributed) solution vector  [2.x.9]  evaluate the gradients at   the (arbitrary and even remote) points specified by  [2.x.10]   
* [0.x.9]*
   Given a (distributed) solution vector  [2.x.11]  evaluate the gradients at   the points specified by  [2.x.12]  which might have been set up by the   above function.    
*  [2.x.13]  Refinement/coarsening/repartitioning leads to the invalidation of the     cache so that the above function has to be called again.  
* [0.x.10]*
     Perform reduction for scalars.    
* [0.x.11]*
     Perform reduction for tensors.    
* [0.x.12]
