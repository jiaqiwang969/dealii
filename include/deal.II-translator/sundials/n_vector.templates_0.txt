[0.x.0]*
     An internal class that stores a pointer to a vector and manages the     memory if necessary. Objects of this class are used as the `content`     field in the SUNDIALS N_Vector module. In addition, this class has a     flag to store whether the stored vector should be treated as const. When     get() is called on a non-const object of this class the flag is checked     and an exception is thrown if the vector is actually const. Thus, we     retain a kind of "runtime const correctness" although the static const     correctness is lost because SUNDIALS N_Vector does not support constness.    
* [0.x.1]*
       Create a non-owning content with an existing  [2.x.0]         [2.x.1]  vector The underlying vector to wrap in this object.      
* [0.x.2]*
       Create a non-owning content with an existing const  [2.x.2]  If this       constructor is used, access is only allowed via the get() const method.        [2.x.3]  vector The underlying vector to wrap in this object.      
* [0.x.3]*
       Allocate a new (non-const) vector wrapped in a new content object. The       vector will be deallocated automatically when this object is destroyed.            
*  [2.x.4]  This constructor is intended for the N_VClone() call of SUNDIALS.      
* [0.x.4]*
       Non-const access to the stored vector. Only allowed if a constructor       different than NVectorContent(const VectorTypevector) was used.        [2.x.5]       
* [0.x.5]*
       Const access to the stored vector. Always allowed.      
* [0.x.6]*
       Vector memory which might be used to allocate storage if       NVectorContent() is called.      
* [0.x.7]*
       Actually stored vector content.      
* [0.x.8]*
       Flag storing whether the stored pointer is to be treated as const. If       the pointer passed in the constructor was indeed const, it is cast away       but this flag will be set to true. Access to the pointer must then       check that this flag is set correctly.      
* [0.x.9]*
     Helper to create a vector with all operations and the given  [2.x.6]           [2.x.7]  content The vector content to attach to the N_Vector.      [2.x.8]  A new N_Vector    
* [0.x.10]*
     Helper to create an empty vector with all operations but no content.      [2.x.9]  A new N_Vector    
* [0.x.11]*
     Collection of all operations specified by SUNDIALS N_Vector     documentation. These functions are attached to the generic N_Vector     structure.    
* [0.x.12]*
       Sundials likes a void* but we want to use the above functions       internally with a safe type.
