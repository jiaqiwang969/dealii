[0.x.0]*
    [2.x.0]  Creation of a LinearOperator  
* [0.x.1]*
    [2.x.1]  LinearOperator     A function that encapsulates generic  [2.x.2]  objects, based on an    [2.x.3]  that act on a compatible Vector type into a   LinearOperator.     This function is the equivalent of the  [2.x.4]  but   ensures full compatibility with Trilinos operations by preselecting the   appropriate template parameters.      
*  [2.x.5]   
* [0.x.2]*
    [2.x.6]  LinearOperator     A function that encapsulates generic  [2.x.7]  objects that act on a   compatible Vector type into a LinearOperator.     This function is the equivalent of the  [2.x.8]  but   ensures full compatibility with Trilinos operations by preselecting the   appropriate template parameters.      
*  [2.x.9]   
* [0.x.3]*
    [2.x.10]  Creation of a BlockLinearOperator  
* [0.x.4]*
    [2.x.11]  BlockLinearOperator     A function that encapsulates a  [2.x.12]  into a BlockLinearOperator.     This function is the equivalent of the  [2.x.13]  but   ensures full compatibility with Trilinos operations by preselecting the   appropriate template parameters.      
*  [2.x.14]   
* [0.x.5]*
    [2.x.15]  BlockLinearOperator     A variant of above function that builds up a block diagonal linear operator   from an array  [2.x.16]  of diagonal elements (off-diagonal blocks are assumed   to be 0).     This function is the equivalent of the  [2.x.17]  but   ensures full compatibility with Trilinos operations by preselecting the   appropriate template parameters.      
*  [2.x.18]   
* [0.x.6]*
    [2.x.19]  BlockLinearOperator     This function extracts the diagonal blocks of  [2.x.20]  (either a   block matrix type or a BlockLinearOperator) and creates a   BlockLinearOperator with the diagonal. Off-diagonal elements are   initialized as null_operator (with correct reinit_range_vector and   reinit_domain_vector methods).     This function is the equivalent of the  [2.x.21]  but   ensures full compatibility with Trilinos operations by preselecting the   appropriate template parameters.      
*  [2.x.22]   
* [0.x.7]*
    [2.x.23]  BlockLinearOperator     A variant of above function that builds up a block diagonal linear operator   from an array  [2.x.24]  of diagonal elements (off-diagonal blocks are assumed   to be 0).     This function is the equivalent of the  [2.x.25]  but   ensures full compatibility with Trilinos operations by preselecting the   appropriate template parameters.
