[0.x.0]!  [2.x.0]  PETScWrappers   [2.x.1]   
* [0.x.1]*
   Implementation of a sequential dense matrix class based on PETSc. All the   functionality is actually in the base class, except for the calls to   generate a sequential dense matrix. This is possible since PETSc only   works on an abstract matrix type and internally distributes to functions   that do the actual work depending on the actual matrix type (much like   using virtual functions). Only the functions creating a matrix of   specific type differ, and are implemented in this particular class.    
*  [2.x.2]   
* [0.x.2]*
     Declare type for container size.    
* [0.x.3]*
     Default constructor. Create an empty matrix.    
* [0.x.4]*
     Create a full matrix of dimensions  [2.x.3]  times  [2.x.4]     
* [0.x.5]*
     Throw away the present matrix and generate one that has the same     properties as if it were created by the constructor of this class with     the same argument list as the present function.    
* [0.x.6]*
     Return a reference to the MPI communicator object in use with this     matrix. Since this is a sequential matrix, it returns the MPI_COMM_SELF     communicator.    
* [0.x.7]*
     Do the actual work for the respective reinit() function and the     matching constructor, i.e. create a matrix. Getting rid of the previous     matrix is left to the caller.
