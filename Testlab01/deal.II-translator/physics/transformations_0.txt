* [0.x.1]*
        [2.x.0]  Rotation matrices      
* [0.x.2]*
       Return the rotation matrix for 2-d Euclidean space, namely       [1.x.0]       where  [2.x.1]  is the rotation angle given in radians. In particular,       this describes the counter-clockwise rotation of a vector relative to       a [1.x.1].              [2.x.2]  angle The rotation angle (about the z-axis) in radians      
* [0.x.3]*
       Return the rotation matrix for 3-d Euclidean space. Most concisely       stated using the Rodrigues' rotation formula, this function returns       the equivalent of       [1.x.2]       where  [2.x.3]  is the axial vector (an axial vector) and  [2.x.4]        is the rotation angle given in radians,  [2.x.5]  is the identity       tensor and  [2.x.6]  is the skew symmetric tensor of  [2.x.7] .              [2.x.8]  This presents Rodrigues' rotation       formula, but the implementation used in this function is described in       this [1.x.3]. In particular, this describes the counter-clockwise       rotation of a vector [1.x.4]. defined by the  [2.x.9]  of rotation. An       alternative implementation is discussed at [1.x.5], but is inconsistent (sign-wise) with the Rodrigues'       rotation formula as it describes the rotation of a coordinate system.
