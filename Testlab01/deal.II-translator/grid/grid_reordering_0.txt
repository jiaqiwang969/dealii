[0.x.0]*
 A class implementing various grid reordering algorithms. For more information see the  [2.x.0]  "reordering module".
*   [2.x.1]  Use  [2.x.2]  or  [2.x.3]  instead of the functions provided by this class. Usage of the old-style numbering is deprecated.

   This is the main function, doing what is announced in the general   documentation of this class for dim=2 and 3 and doing nothing for dim=1.     If a consistent reordering is not possible in dim=3, the original   connectivity data is restored.      [2.x.4]  original_cells An object that contains the data that describes the   mesh.    [2.x.5]  use_new_style_ordering If true, then use the standard ordering of   vertices within a cell. If false (the default), then use the "old-style"   ordering of vertices within cells used by deal.II before version 5.2 and   as explained in the documentation of this class.      [2.x.6]  Use  [2.x.7]  instead.  
* [0.x.2]*
   Grids generated by grid generators may have an orientation of cells which   is the inverse of the orientation required by deal.II.     In 2d and 3d this function checks whether all cells have negative or   positive measure/volume. In the former case, all cells are inverted. It   does nothing in 1d.     The inversion of cells might also work when only a subset of all cells   have negative volume. However, grids consisting of a mixture of negative   and positively oriented cells are very likely to be broken. Therefore, an   exception is thrown, in case cells are not uniformly oriented.     Note, that this function should be called before reorder_cells().      [2.x.8]  all_vertices The vertices of the mesh.    [2.x.9]  original_cells An object that contains the data that describes the   mesh.    [2.x.10]  use_new_style_ordering If true, then use the standard ordering of   vertices within a cell. If false (the default), then use the "old-style"   ordering of vertices within cells used by deal.II before version 5.2 and   as explained in the documentation of this class.      [2.x.11]  Use  [2.x.12]  instead.
