[0.x.0]*
     Structure for storing degree of freedom information for cells,     organized by levels.         We store are cached values for the DoF indices on each cell     in#cell_dof_indices_cache, since this is a frequently requested     operation. The values are set by      [2.x.0]  and are used by      [2.x.1]          Note that vertices are separate from, and in fact have nothing to do     with cells. The indices of degrees of freedom located on vertices     therefore are not stored here, but rather in member variables of the      [2.x.2]  class.         The indices of degrees of freedom located on lower dimensional objects,     i.e. on lines for 2D and on quads and lines for 3D are treated     similarly than that on cells. However, these geometrical objects, which     are called faces as a generalization, are not organised in a     hierarchical structure of levels. Therefore, the degrees of freedom     located on these objects are stored in separate classes, namely the     <tt>DoFFaces</tt> classes.         Access to this object is usually through the      [2.x.3]  and  [2.x.4]  functions or     similar functions of derived classes that in turn access the member     variables using the  [2.x.5]  and corresponding     setter functions. Knowledge of the actual data format is therefore     encapsulated to the present hierarchy of classes as well as the      [2.x.6]  class.    
* [0.x.1]*
       Cache for the DoF indices on cells. The size of this array equals the       number of cells on a given level times selected_fe.n_dofs_per_cell().      
* [0.x.2]*
       The object containing dof-indices and related access-functions      
* [0.x.3]*
       Return a pointer to the beginning of the DoF indices cache for a       given cell.              [2.x.7]  obj_index The number of the cell we are looking at.        [2.x.8]  dofs_per_cell The number of DoFs per cell for this cell.        [2.x.9]  A pointer to the first DoF index for the current cell. The       next dofs_per_cell indices are for the current cell.      
* [0.x.4]*
       Determine an estimate for the memory consumption (in bytes) of this       object.      
* [0.x.5]*
       Read or write the data of this object to or from a stream for the       purpose of serialization using the [BOOST serialization       library](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_74_0/libs/serialization/doc/index.html).
