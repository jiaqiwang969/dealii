*  [2.x.0] 
*  This module simply collects a number of functions and classes that provide general tools for tasks that do not usually have much to do with finite element programs in particular, but happen to be required there just as well.

*  [2.x.1] 
*  Here are a few simple classes that help in storage and viewing data. For example, the Table templates allow to use not only arrays of objects (for which one might want to use the  [2.x.2]  class), but also two-dimensional (rectangular) tables of arbitrary objects, as well as higher-order analogs up to tables with (presently) seven indices.
*  Similarly, the VectorSlice function is a primitive that takes anything that has an interface that resembles a vector (for example the deal.II Vector or the  [2.x.3]  classes) and presents a view on it as if it were a vector in itself.
