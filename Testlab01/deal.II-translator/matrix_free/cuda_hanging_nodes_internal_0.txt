[0.x.0]*
     This class creates the mask used in the treatment of hanging nodes in      [2.x.0]      The implementation of this class is explained in  [2.x.1] Section 3 of     Matrix-Free Finite-Element Computations On Graphics Processors With     Adaptively Refined Unstructured Meshes [2.x.2]  by Karl Ljungkvist,     SpringSim-HPC, 2017 April 23-26.    
* [0.x.1]*
       Constructor.      
* [0.x.2]*
       Compute the value of the constraint mask for a given cell.      
* [0.x.3]*
       Set up line-to-cell mapping for edge constraints in 3D.      
* [0.x.4]*
     This function resolves the hanging nodes using tensor product.
