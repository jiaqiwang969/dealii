[0.x.0]*
     Namespace containing classes for inter-process data exchange (i.e.,     for update_ghost_values and compress) in MatrixFree.    
* [0.x.1]*
       Interface needed by MatrixFree.      
* [0.x.2]*
       Class that simply delegates the task to a  [2.x.0]       
* [0.x.3]*
       Similar to the above but using the internal data structures in the       partitioner in order to identify indices of degrees of freedom that are       in the same shared memory region.      
* [0.x.4]*
         Global communicator.        
* [0.x.5]*
         Shared-memory sub-communicator.        
* [0.x.6]*
         Number of locally-owned vector entries.        
* [0.x.7]*
         Number of ghost vector entries.        
* [0.x.8]*
         Number of global vector entries.        
* [0.x.9]*
         A variable caching the number of ghost indices in a larger set of         indices by rank.        
* [0.x.10]*
         The set of indices that appear for an IndexSet that is a subset of a         larger set for each rank in a compressed manner.        
* [0.x.11]*
         An array that contains information which processors my ghost indices         belong to, at which offset and how many those indices are        
* [0.x.12]*
         The set of processors and length of data field which send us their         ghost data.                
*  [2.x.1]  Structured as ghost_targets_data.        
* [0.x.13]*
         An array that caches the number of chunks in the import indices per         MPI rank. The length is import_indices_data.size()+1.                 The set of (local) indices that we are importing during compress()         from remote processes, i.e., others' ghosts that belong to the local         range.        
* [0.x.14]*
         Shared-memory ranks from which data is copied from during         export_to_ghosted_array_finish().        
* [0.x.15]*
         Indices from where to copy data from during         export_to_ghosted_array_finish().        
* [0.x.16]*
         Indices where to copy data to during         export_to_ghosted_array_finish().        
* [0.x.17]*
         Shared-memory ranks from where to copy data from during         import_from_ghosted_array_finish().        
* [0.x.18]*
         Indices from where to copy data from during         import_from_ghosted_array_finish().        
* [0.x.19]*
         Indices where to copy data to during         import_from_ghosted_array_finish().        
* [0.x.20]
