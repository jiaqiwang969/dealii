* This tutorial depends on  [2.x.1] .

* 
* This example shows the basic usage of the multilevel functions in deal.II. Itsolves almost the same problem as used in  [2.x.3] , but demonstrating the thingsone has to provide when using multigrid as a preconditioner. In particular, thisrequires that we define a hierarchy of levels, provide transfer operators fromone level to the next and back, and provide representations of the Laplaceoperator on each level.
* In order to allow sufficient flexibility in conjunction with systems ofdifferential equations and block preconditioners, quite a few different objectshave to be created before starting the multilevel method, althoughmost of what needs to be done is provided by deal.II itself. These are
* 

* 
* 

* 
* 
*  - the object handling transfer between grids; we use the MGTransferPrebuilt    class for this that does almost all of the work inside the library,
* 

* 
* 

* 
* 
*  - the solver on the coarsest level; here, we use MGCoarseGridHouseholder,
* 

* 
* 

* 
* 
*  - the smoother on all other levels, which in our case will be the     [2.x.4]  class using SOR as the underlying method,
* 

* 
* 

* 
* 
*  - and  [2.x.5]  a class having a special level multiplication, i.e. we    basically store one matrix per grid level and allow multiplication with it.
* Most of these objects will only be needed inside the function thatactually solves the linear system. There, these objects are combinedin an object of type Multigrid, containing the implementation of theV-cycle, which is in turn used by the preconditioner PreconditionMG,ready for plug-in into a linear solver of the LAC library.
* The multigrid method implemented here for adaptively refined meshes follows theoutline in the  [2.x.6]  "Multigrid paper", which describes the underlyingimplementation in deal.II and also introduces a lot of the nomenclature. First,we have to distinguish between level meshes, namely cells that have the samerefinement distance from the coarse mesh, and the leaf mesh consisting of activecells of the hierarchy (in older work we refer to this as the global mesh, butthis term is overused). Most importantly, the leaf mesh is not identical withthe level mesh on the finest level. The following image shows what we considerto be a "level mesh":
*  [2.x.7] 
* The fine level in this mesh consists only of the degrees of freedom that aredefined on the refined cells, but does not extend to that part of the domainthat is not refined. While this guarantees that the overall effort grows as [2.x.8]  as necessary for optimal multigrid complexity, it leads toproblems when defining where to smooth and what boundary conditions to pose forthe operators defined on individual levels if the level boundary is not anexternal boundary. These questions are discussed in detail in the article citedabove.
* [1.x.24][1.x.25]
* 

* The problem we solve here is similar to  [2.x.9] , with two maindifferences: first, the multigrid preconditioner, obviously. We alsochange the discontinuity of the coefficients such that the localassembler does not look more complicated than necessary.
* 

*  [1.x.26] [1.x.27]
*   [1.x.28]  [1.x.29]
* 

* 
*  Again, the first few include files are already known, so we won't comment on them:
* 

* 
* [1.x.30]
* 
*  These, now, are the include necessary for the multilevel methods. The first one declares how to handle Dirichlet boundary conditions on each of the levels of the multigrid method. For the actual description of the degrees of freedom, we do not need any new include file because DoFHandler already has all necessary methods implemented. We will only need to distribute the DoFs for the levels further down.
* 

* 
*  The rest of the include files deals with the mechanics of multigrid as a linear operator (solver or preconditioner).
* 

* 
* [1.x.31]
* 
*  We will be using  [2.x.10]  to loop over the cells, so include it here:
* 

* 
* [1.x.32]
* 
*  This is C++:
* 

* 
* [1.x.33]
* 
*   [1.x.34]  [1.x.35]   
*   We use  [2.x.11]  to assemble our matrices. For this, we need a ScratchData object to store temporary data on each cell (this is just the FEValues object) and a CopyData object that will contain the output of each cell assembly. For more details about the usage of scratch and copy objects, see the WorkStream namespace.
* 

* 
* [1.x.36]
* 
*   [1.x.37]  [1.x.38]
* 

* 
*  This main class is similar to the same class in  [2.x.12] . As far as member functions is concerned, the only additions are:
* 

* 
* 
*  - The  [2.x.13]  function that assembles the matrices that correspond to the discrete operators on intermediate levels.
* 

* 
* 
*  - The  [2.x.14]  function that assembles our PDE on a single cell.
* 

* 
* [1.x.39]
* 
*  The following members are the essential data structures for the multigrid method. The first four represent the sparsity patterns and the matrices on individual levels of the multilevel hierarchy, very much like the objects for the global mesh above.     
*   Then we have two new matrices only needed for multigrid methods with local smoothing on adaptive meshes. They convey data between the interior part of the refined region and the refinement edge, as outlined in detail in the  [2.x.15]  "multigrid paper".     
*   The last object stores information about the boundary indices on each level and information about indices lying on a refinement edge between two different refinement levels. It thus serves a similar purpose as AffineConstraints, but on each level.
* 

* 
* [1.x.40]
* 
*   [1.x.41]  [1.x.42]
* 

* 
*  Just one short remark about the constructor of the Triangulation: by convention, all adaptively refined triangulations in deal.II never change by more than one level across a face between cells. For our multigrid algorithms, however, we need a slightly stricter guarantee, namely that the mesh also does not change by more than refinement level across vertices that might connect two cells. In other words, we must prevent the following situation:   
*    [2.x.16]    
*   This is achieved by passing the  [2.x.17]  flag to the constructor of the triangulation class.
* 

* 
* [1.x.43]
* 
*   [1.x.44]  [1.x.45]
* 

* 
*  In addition to just distributing the degrees of freedom in the DoFHandler, we do the same on each level. Then, we follow the same procedure as before to set up the system on the leaf mesh.
* 

* 
* [1.x.46]
* 
*  The multigrid constraints have to be initialized. They need to know where Dirichlet boundary conditions are prescribed.
* 

* 
* [1.x.47]
* 
*  Now for the things that concern the multigrid data structures. First, we resize the multilevel objects to hold matrices and sparsity patterns for every level. The coarse level is zero (this is mandatory right now but may change in a future revision). Note that these functions take a complete, inclusive range here (not a starting index and size), so the finest level is  [2.x.18] . We first have to resize the container holding the SparseMatrix classes, since they have to release their SparsityPattern before the can be destroyed upon resizing.
* 

* 
* [1.x.48]
* 
*  Now, we have to provide a matrix on each level. To this end, we first use the  [2.x.19]  function to generate a preliminary compressed sparsity pattern on each level (see the  [2.x.20]  module for more information on this topic) and then copy it over to the one we really want. The next step is to initialize the interface matrices with the fitting sparsity pattern.     
*   It may be worth pointing out that the interface matrices only have entries for degrees of freedom that sit at or next to the interface between coarser and finer levels of the mesh. They are therefore even sparser than the matrices on the individual levels of our multigrid hierarchy. Therefore, we use a function specifically build for this purpose to generate it.
* 

* 
* [1.x.49]
* 
*   [1.x.50]  [1.x.51]
* 

* 
*  The cell_worker function is used to assemble the matrix and right-hand side on the given cell. This function is used for the active cells to generate the system_matrix and on each level to build the level matrices.   
*   Note that we also assemble a right-hand side when called from assemble_multigrid() even though it is not used.
* 

* 
* [1.x.52]
* 
*   [1.x.53]  [1.x.54]
* 

* 
*  The following function assembles the linear system on the active cells of the mesh. For this, we pass two lambda functions to the mesh_loop() function. The cell_worker function redirects to the class member function of the same name, while the copier is specific to this function and copies local matrix and vector to the corresponding global ones using the constraints.
* 

* 
* [1.x.55]
* 
*   [1.x.56]  [1.x.57]
* 

* 
*  The next function is the one that builds the matrices that define the multigrid method on each level of the mesh. The integration core is the same as above, but the loop below will go over all existing cells instead of just the active ones, and the results must be entered into the correct level matrices. Fortunately, MeshWorker hides most of that from us, and thus the difference between this function and the previous lies only in the setup of the assembler and the different iterators in the loop.   
*   We generate an AffineConstraints object for each level containing the boundary and interface dofs as constrained entries. The corresponding object is then used to generate the level matrices.
* 

* 
* [1.x.58]
* 
*  Interface entries are ignored by the boundary_constraints object above when filling the mg_matrices[cd.level]. Instead, we copy these entries into the interface matrix of the current level manually:
* 

* 
* [1.x.59]
* 
*   [1.x.60]  [1.x.61]
* 

* 
*  This is the other function that is significantly different in support of the multigrid solver (or, in fact, the preconditioner for which we use the multigrid method).   
*   Let us start out by setting up two of the components of multilevel methods: transfer operators between levels, and a solver on the coarsest level. In finite element methods, the transfer operators are derived from the finite element function spaces involved and can often be computed in a generic way independent of the problem under consideration. In that case, we can use the MGTransferPrebuilt class that, given the constraints of the final linear system and the MGConstrainedDoFs object that knows about the boundary conditions on the each level and the degrees of freedom on interfaces between different refinement level can build the matrices for those transfer operations from a DoFHandler object with level degrees of freedom.   
*   The second part of the following lines deals with the coarse grid solver. Since our coarse grid is very coarse indeed, we decide for a direct solver (a Householder decomposition of the coarsest level matrix), even if its implementation is not particularly sophisticated. If our coarse mesh had many more cells than the five we have here, something better suited would obviously be necessary here.
* 

* 
* [1.x.62]
* 
*  The next component of a multilevel solver or preconditioner is that we need a smoother on each level. A common choice for this is to use the application of a relaxation method (such as the SOR, Jacobi or Richardson method) or a small number of iterations of a solver method (such as CG or GMRES). The  [2.x.21]  and MGSmootherPrecondition classes provide support for these two kinds of smoothers. Here, we opt for the application of a single SOR iteration. To this end, we define an appropriate alias and then setup a smoother object.     
*   The last step is to initialize the smoother object with our level matrices and to set some smoothing parameters. The  [2.x.22]  function can optionally take additional arguments that will be passed to the smoother object on each level. In the current case for the SOR smoother, this could, for example, include a relaxation parameter. However, we here leave these at their default values. The call to  [2.x.23]  indicates that we will use two pre- and two post-smoothing steps on each level; to use a variable number of smoother steps on different levels, more options can be set in the constructor call to the  [2.x.24]  object.     
*   The last step results from the fact that we use the SOR method as a smoother
* 
*  - which is not symmetric
* 
*  - but we use the conjugate gradient iteration (which requires a symmetric preconditioner) below, we need to let the multilevel preconditioner make sure that we get a symmetric operator even for nonsymmetric smoothers:
* 

* 
* [1.x.63]
* 
*  The next preparatory step is that we must wrap our level and interface matrices in an object having the required multiplication functions. We will create two objects for the interface objects going from coarse to fine and the other way around; the multigrid algorithm will later use the transpose operator for the latter operation, allowing us to initialize both up and down versions of the operator with the matrices we already built:
* 

* 
* [1.x.64]
* 
*  Now, we are ready to set up the V-cycle operator and the multilevel preconditioner.
* 

* 
* [1.x.65]
* 
*  With all this together, we can finally get about solving the linear system in the usual way:
* 

* 
* [1.x.66]
* 
*   [1.x.67]  [1.x.68]
* 

* 
*  The following two functions postprocess a solution once it is computed. In particular, the first one refines the mesh at the beginning of each cycle while the second one outputs results at the end of each such cycle. The functions are almost unchanged from those in  [2.x.25] .
* 

* 
* [1.x.69]
* 
*   [1.x.70]  [1.x.71]
* 

* 
*  Like several of the functions above, this is almost exactly a copy of the corresponding function in  [2.x.26] . The only difference is the call to  [2.x.27]  that takes care of forming the matrices on every level that we need in the multigrid method.
* 

* 
* [1.x.72]
* 
*   [1.x.73]  [1.x.74]
* 

* 
*  This is again the same function as in  [2.x.28] :
* 

* 
* [1.x.75]
* [1.x.76][1.x.77]
* 

* On the finest mesh, the solution looks like this:
*  [2.x.29] 
* More importantly, we would like to see if the multigrid method really improvedthe solver performance. Therefore, here is the textual output:
* <pre>Cycle 0   Number of active cells:       80   Number of degrees of freedom: 89 (by level: 8, 25, 89)   Number of CG iterations: 8
* Cycle 1   Number of active cells:       158   Number of degrees of freedom: 183 (by level: 8, 25, 89, 138)   Number of CG iterations: 9
* Cycle 2   Number of active cells:       302   Number of degrees of freedom: 352 (by level: 8, 25, 89, 223, 160)   Number of CG iterations: 10
* Cycle 3   Number of active cells:       578   Number of degrees of freedom: 649 (by level: 8, 25, 89, 231, 494, 66)   Number of CG iterations: 10
* Cycle 4   Number of active cells:       1100   Number of degrees of freedom: 1218 (by level: 8, 25, 89, 274, 764, 417, 126)   Number of CG iterations: 10
* Cycle 5   Number of active cells:       2096   Number of degrees of freedom: 2317 (by level: 8, 25, 89, 304, 779, 1214, 817)   Number of CG iterations: 11
* Cycle 6   Number of active cells:       3986   Number of degrees of freedom: 4366 (by level: 8, 25, 89, 337, 836, 2270, 897, 1617)   Number of CG iterations: 10
* Cycle 7   Number of active cells:       7574   Number of degrees of freedom: 8350 (by level: 8, 25, 89, 337, 1086, 2835, 2268, 1789, 3217)   Number of CG iterations: 11</pre>
* That's almost perfect multigrid performance: the linear residual gets reduced by 12 orders ofmagnitude in 10 iteration steps, and the results are almost independent of the mesh size. That'sobviously in part due to the simple nature of the problem solved, butit shows the power of multigrid methods.
* 

* [1.x.78][1.x.79]
* 

* 
* We encourage you to generate timings for the solve() call and compare to [2.x.30] . You will see that the multigrid method has quite an overheadon coarse meshes, but that it always beats other methods on finemeshes because of its optimal complexity.
* A close inspection of this program's performance shows that it is mostlydominated by matrix-vector operations.  [2.x.31]  shows one wayhow this can be avoided by working with matrix-free methods.
* Another avenue would be to use algebraic multigrid methods. The geometricmultigrid method used here can at times be a bit awkward to implement because itneeds all those additional data structures, and it becomes even more difficultif the program is to run in %parallel on machines coupled through MPI, forexample. In that case, it would be simpler if one could use a black-boxpreconditioner that uses some sort of multigrid hierarchy for good performancebut can figure out level matrices and similar things by itself. Algebraicmultigrid methods do exactly this, and we will use them in  [2.x.32]  for thesolution of a Stokes problem and in  [2.x.33]  and  [2.x.34]  for a parallelvariation. That said, a parallel version of this example program with MPI can befound in  [2.x.35] .
* Finally, one may want to think how to use geometric multigrid for other kinds ofproblems, specifically  [2.x.36]  "vector valued problems". This is thetopic of  [2.x.37]  where we use the techniques shown here for the Stokes equation.
