[0.x.0]*
   Base class for Point-based predicates providing basic functionality for   derived classes, not supposed to be used on its own.

* [0.x.15]*
   This class is used by  [2.x.18]  to determine for given bounding   boxes which are the nearest bounding boxes/points among the ones used to   build the  [2.x.19]   
*  [2.x.20]  The class is not supposed to be used in a polymorphic context.
