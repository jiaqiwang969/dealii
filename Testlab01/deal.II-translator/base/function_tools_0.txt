[0.x.0]*
   Estimate bounds on the value and bounds on each gradient component of a   Function,  [2.x.0] , over a BoundingBox, by approximating it by a 2nd order   Taylor polynomial starting from the box center.     Each lower and upper bound is returned as a    [2.x.1] , such that the first entry is the   lower bound,  [2.x.2] , and the second is the upper bound,  [2.x.3] , i.e.    [2.x.4] .     The function value, gradient, and Hessian are computed at the box center.   The bounds on the value of the function are then estimated as      [2.x.5] ,   where    [2.x.6] .     Here,  [2.x.7]  is half the side length of the box in the  [2.x.8] th coordinate   direction, which is the distance we extrapolate. The bounds on the gradient   components are estimated similarly as      [2.x.9] ,   where    [2.x.10] .     If the function has more than 1 component the  [2.x.11]  parameter can   be used to specify which function component the bounds should be computed   for.
