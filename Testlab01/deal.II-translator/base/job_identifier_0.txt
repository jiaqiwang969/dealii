* [0.x.2]*
   This function returns an identifier for the running program. Currently,   the library provides a function returning "JobID".     The user may define a replacement of this function in their source code and   avoid linking the library version. Unfortunately, this mechanism does not   work with shared libraries.  
* [0.x.3]*
   Obtain the base name of the filename passed as argument. That is,   if the file is <tt>mypath/file.cc</tt> return just   <tt>file</tt>. For example, this function can be called from a   user program with argument <tt>__FILE__</tt> to create an   identifier for the program being run.  
* [0.x.4]*
   Return the value of <tt>id</tt>.  
* [0.x.5]*
   %Function to identify the presently running program.
