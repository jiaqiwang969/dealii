[0.x.0]*
 This class implements Bernstein basis polynomials of desire degree as described in http://www.idav.ucdavis.edu/education/CAGDNotes/Bernstein-Polynomials.pdf in the paragraph "Converting from the Bernstein Basis to the Power Basis".
*  They are used to create the Bernstein finite element FE_Bernstein.
