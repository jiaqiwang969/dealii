[0.x.0]*
 Returns whether we need to correct the Hessians and third derivatives with the derivatives of the Jacobian. This is determined by checking if the jacobian_pushed_forward are zero.
*  Especially for the third derivatives, the correction term is very expensive, which is why we check if the derivatives are zero before computing the correction.
