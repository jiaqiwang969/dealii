[0.x.0]*
 Implementation of a scalar Lagrange finite element  [2.x.0]  that yields the finite element space of continuous, piecewise polynomials of degree  [2.x.1]  in each coordinate direction plus some (non-normalized) bubble enrichment space spanned by the additional shape function  [2.x.2] . for  [2.x.3] .  If  [2.x.4]  is one, then the first factor disappears and one receives the usual bubble function centered at the mid-point of the cell. Because these last shape functions have polynomial degree is  [2.x.5] , the overall polynomial degree of the shape functions in the space described by this class is  [2.x.6] .
*  This class is realized using tensor product polynomials based on equidistant or given support points, in the same way as one can provide support points to the FE_Q class's constructors.
*  For more information about the <tt>spacedim</tt> template parameter check the documentation of the FiniteElement class, or the one of Triangulation.
*  Due to the fact that the enrichments are small almost everywhere for large  [2.x.7] , the condition number for the mass and stiffness matrix quickly increaseses with increasing  [2.x.8] . Below you see a comparison with FE_Q(QGaussLobatto(p+1)) for dim=1.
*   [2.x.9] 
*  Therefore, this element should be used with care for  [2.x.10] .
* 

*  [1.x.0]
*  The constructor creates a TensorProductPolynomials object that includes the tensor product of  [2.x.11]  polynomials of degree  [2.x.12]  plus the bubble enrichments. This  [2.x.13]  object provides all values and derivatives of the shape functions. In case a quadrature rule is given, the constructor creates a TensorProductPolynomialsBubbles object that includes the tensor product of  [2.x.14]  polynomials with the support points from  [2.x.15]  and the bubble enrichments as defined above.
*  Furthermore the constructor fills the  [2.x.16]  the  [2.x.17]  prolongation (embedding) and the  [2.x.18]  matrices.
* 

*  [1.x.1]
*  The original ordering of the shape functions represented by the TensorProductPolynomialsBubbles is a tensor product numbering. However, the shape functions on a cell are renumbered beginning with the shape functions whose support points are at the vertices, then on the line, on the quads, and finally (for 3d) on the hexes. Finally, there are support points for the bubble enrichments in the middle of the cell.

* [0.x.1]*
   Constructor for tensor product polynomials of degree  [2.x.19]  plus bubble   enrichments  
* [0.x.2]*
   Constructor for tensor product polynomials with support points    [2.x.20]  plus bubble enrichments based on a one-dimensional   quadrature formula.  The degree of the finite element is then   <tt>points.size()</tt>, the plus one compared to the   corresponding case for the FE_Q class coming from the additional   bubble function. See the documentation of the FE_Q constructors   for more information.     Note that the first point has to be 0   and the last one 1.  
* [0.x.3]*
   Return a string that uniquely identifies a finite element. This class   returns <tt>FE_Q_Bubbles<dim>(degree)</tt>, with  [2.x.21]  and  [2.x.22]    replaced by appropriate values.  
* [0.x.4]*
   Return the matrix interpolating from the given finite element to the   present one.  The size of the matrix is then  [2.x.23]  times   <tt>source.n_dofs_per_cell()</tt>.     These matrices are only available if the source element is also a  [2.x.24]    FE_Q_Bubbles element. Otherwise, an exception of type    [2.x.25]  is thrown.  
* [0.x.5]*
   Check for non-zero values on a face.     This function returns  [2.x.26]  if the shape function  [2.x.27]  has   non-zero values on the face  [2.x.28]      Implementation of the interface in FiniteElement

    [2.x.29]   [2.x.30]   
* [0.x.7]*
   Return the restriction_is_additive flags. Only the last components for   the bubble enrichments are true.  
* [0.x.8]*
   Only for internal use. Its full name is  [2.x.31]    function and it creates the  [2.x.32]  vector that is needed   within the constructor to be passed to the constructor of  [2.x.33]    FiniteElementData.

   Number of additional bubble functions
