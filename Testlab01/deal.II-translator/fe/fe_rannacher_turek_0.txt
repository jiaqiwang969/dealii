[0.x.0]*
 Implementation of the Rannacher-Turek element. This element is used to generate a stable pair of function spaces for the Stokes equation without having to increase the polynomial degree of the velocity space as much as one would do for the stable Taylor-Hood element which uses the  [2.x.0]  pair for velocity and pressure. That said, like many other non-conforming elements, it can also be used for the discretization of the Laplace equation. The element was first described in R. Rannacher and S. Turek: "Simple non-conforming quadrilateral Stokes element", Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations, vol. 8, pp. 97-112, 1992.
*  The shape functions generated by this element are in general discontinuous, and consequently the element is not  [2.x.1]  conforming (i.e., it is a "non-conforming" element). However, the shape functions are constructed in such a way that the jump along faces has mean value zero, and consequently there is [1.x.0] sort of conformity in the element: a conforming element would have a pointwise zero jump, a completely discontinuous element like the FE_DGQ elements can have entirely arbitrary values for the jump across a face, and the current element is somewhere in the middle because its jump is nonzero but at least has mean value zero.
*  The element is currently implemented only in dimension 2, for the lowest polynomial order, and without hanging nodes and restriction/prolongation.

*  [1.x.1]
*  [1.x.2]
*  The  [2.x.2]  "node values" are moments on faces.
*  [1.x.3]
*  To calculate the node values, we are using a QGauss rule on each face. By default, we are using a two point rule to integrate Rannacher-Turek functions exactly. But in order to be able to interpolate other functions with sufficient accuracy, the number of quadrature points used on a face can be adjusted in the constructor.

* [0.x.1]*
   Constructor for Rannacher-Turek element of given  [2.x.4]  using  [2.x.5]    n_face_support_points quadrature points on each face for interpolation.   Notice that the element of order 0 contains polynomials of degree 2.     The element is currently only implemented for order 0 in 2D.  
* [0.x.2]*
   Order of this element.  
* [0.x.3]*
   The number of quadrature points used on each face to evaluate node   functionals during interpolation.  
* [0.x.4]*
   The weights used on the faces to evaluate node functionals.  
* [0.x.5]*
   Compute generalized support points and their weights.  
* [0.x.6]*
   Return information about degrees of freedom per object as needed during   construction.
