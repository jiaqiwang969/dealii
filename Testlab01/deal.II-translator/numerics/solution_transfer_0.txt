[0.x.0]*
 This class implements the transfer of a discrete FE function (e.g. a solution vector) from one mesh to another that is obtained from the first by a single refinement and/or coarsening step. During interpolation the vector is reinitialized to the new size and filled with the interpolated values. This class is used in the  [2.x.0] ,  [2.x.1] ,  [2.x.2] , and  [2.x.3]  tutorial programs. A version of this class that works on parallel triangulations is available as  [2.x.4] 
*  [1.x.0]
*  This class implements the algorithms in two different ways:  [2.x.5]   [2.x.6]  If the grid will only be refined (i.e. no cells are coarsened) then use  [2.x.7]  as follows:

* 
* [1.x.1]
* 
*  Then to proceed do

* 
* [1.x.2]
* 
*  Although the  [2.x.8]  functions are allowed to be called multiple times, e.g. for interpolating several solution vectors, there is the following possibility of interpolating several functions simultaneously.

* 
* [1.x.3]
*  This is used in several of the tutorial programs, for example  [2.x.9] .
*   [2.x.10]  If the grid has cells that will be coarsened, then use  [2.x.11]  SolutionTransfer as follows:

* 
* [1.x.4]
* 
*  If the grid is partitioned across several MPI processes, then it is important to note that the old solution(s) must be copied to one that also provides access to the locally relevant DoF values (these values required for the interpolation process):

* 
* [1.x.5]
* 
*  Multiple calls to the function <code>interpolate (const VectorType &in, VectorType &out)</code> are NOT allowed. Interpolating several functions can be performed in one step by using <tt>void interpolate (const vector<VectorType> &all_in, vector<VectorType> &all_out) const</tt>, and using the respective  [2.x.12]  prepare_for_coarsening_and_refinement function taking several vectors as input before actually refining and coarsening the triangulation (see there).  [2.x.13] 
*  For deleting all stored data in  [2.x.14]  and reinitializing it use the <tt>clear()</tt> function.
*  The template argument  [2.x.15]  denotes the type of data container you want to transfer.
* 

*  [1.x.6]
*  The interpolation onto the new mesh is a local operation, i.e., it interpolates onto the new mesh only. If that new mesh has hanging nodes, you will therefore get a solution that does not satisfy hanging node constraints. The same is true with boundary values: the interpolated solution will just be the interpolation of the old solution at the boundary, and this may or may not satisfy boundary values at newly introduced boundary nodes.
*  Consequently, you may have to apply hanging node or boundary value constraints after interpolation.  [2.x.16]  and  [2.x.17]  have examples of dealing with this.
* 

*  [1.x.7]
*   [2.x.18]   [2.x.19]  Solution transfer with only refinement. Assume that we have got a solution vector on the current (original) grid. Each entry of this vector belongs to one of the DoFs of the discretization. If we now refine the grid then the calling of  [2.x.20]  will change at least some of the DoF indices. Hence we need to store the DoF indices of all active cells before the refinement. A pointer for each active cell is used to point to the vector of these DoF indices of that cell. This is done by prepare_for_pure_refinement().
*  In the function <tt>refine_interpolate(in,out)</tt> and on each cell where the pointer is set (i.e. the cells that were active in the original grid) we can now access the local values of the solution vector  [2.x.21]  on that cell by using the stored DoF indices. These local values are interpolated and set into the vector  [2.x.22]  that is at the end the discrete function  [2.x.23]  in interpolated on the refined mesh.
*  The <tt>refine_interpolate(in,out)</tt> function can be called multiple times for arbitrary many discrete functions (solution vectors) on the original grid.
*   [2.x.24]  Solution transfer with coarsening and refinement. After calling  [2.x.25]  the coarsen flags of either all or none of the children of a (father-)cell are set. While coarsening  [2.x.26]  the cells that are not needed any more will be deleted from the Triangulation.
*  For the interpolation from the (to be coarsenend) children to their father the children cells are needed. Hence this interpolation and the storing of the interpolated values of each of the discrete functions that we want to interpolate needs to take place before these children cells are coarsened (and deleted!!). Again a pointer for each relevant cell is set to point to these values (see below). Additionally the DoF indices of the cells that will not be coarsened need to be stored according to the solution transfer with pure refinement (cf there). All this is performed by <tt>prepare_for_coarsening_and_refinement(all_in)</tt> where the <tt>vector<VectorType> all_in</tt> includes all discrete functions to be interpolated onto the new grid.
*  As we need two different kinds of pointers (<tt>vector<unsigned int></tt> for the Dof indices and <tt>vector<VectorType></tt> for the interpolated DoF values) we use the  [2.x.27]  that includes both of these pointers and the pointer for each cell points to these  [2.x.28]  Pointerstructs. On each cell only one of the two different pointers is used at one time hence we could use a <tt>void pointer</tt> as <tt>vector<unsigned int></tt> at one time and as <tt>vector<VectorType></tt> at the other but using this  [2.x.29]  Pointerstruct in between makes the use of these pointers more safe and gives better possibility to expand their usage.
*  In <tt>interpolate(all_in, all_out)</tt> the refined cells are treated according to the solution transfer while pure refinement. Additionally, on each cell that is coarsened (hence previously was a father cell), the values of the discrete functions in  [2.x.30]  are set to the stored local interpolated values that are accessible due to the 'vector<VectorType>' pointer in  [2.x.31]  that is pointed to by the pointer of that cell. It is clear that <tt>interpolate(all_in, all_out)</tt> only can be called with the <tt>vector<VectorType> all_in</tt> that previously was the parameter of the <tt>prepare_for_coarsening_and_refinement(all_in)</tt> function. Hence <tt>interpolate(all_in, all_out)</tt> can (in contrast to <tt>refine_interpolate(in, out)</tt>) only be called once.  [2.x.32] 
* 

*  [1.x.8]
*  This class does its best to represent on the new mesh the finite element function that existed on the old mesh, but this may lead to situations where the function on the new mesh is no longer conforming at hanging nodes. To this end, consider a situation of a twice refined mesh that started with a single square cell (i.e., we now have 16 cells). Consider also that we coarsen 4 of the cells back to the first refinement level. In this case, we end up with a mesh that will look as follows if we were to use a  [2.x.33]  element:
*   [2.x.34] 
*  The process of interpolating from the old to the new mesh would imply that the values of the finite element function will not change on all of the cells that remained as they are (i.e., the fine cells) but that on the coarse cell at the top right, the four values at the vertices are obtained by interpolating down from its former children.  If the original function was not linear, this implies that the marked hanging nodes will retain their old values which, in general, will not lead to a continuous function along the corresponding edges. In other words, the solution vector obtained after  [2.x.35]  does not satisfy hanging node constraints: it corresponds to the pointwise interpolation, but not to the interpolation [1.x.9].
*  Whether this is a problem you need to worry about or not depends on your application. The situation is easily corrected, of course, by applying  [2.x.36]  to your solution vector after transfer, using a constraints object computed on the new DoFHandler object (you probably need to create this object anyway if you have hanging nodes). This is also what is done, for example, in  [2.x.37] .
* 

* 
*  [2.x.38]  This situation can only happen if you do coarsening. If all cells remain as they are or are refined, then  [2.x.39]  computes a new vector of nodal values, but the function represented is of course exactly the same because the old finite element space is a subspace of the new one. Thus, if the old function was conforming (i.e., satisfied hanging node constraints), then so does the new one, and it is not necessary to call  [2.x.40] 
* 

*  [1.x.10]
*  In the case of DoFHandlers with hp-capabilities, nothing defines which of the finite elements that are part of the  [2.x.41]  associated with the DoFHandler, should be considered on cells that are not active (i.e., that have children). This is because degrees of freedom are only allocated for active cells and, in fact, it is not allowed to set an active FE index on non- active cells using  [2.x.42] 
*  It is, thus, not entirely natural what should happen if, for example, a few cells are coarsened away. This class then implements the following algorithm:
* 

* 
* 
*  - If a cell is refined, then the values of the solution vector(s) are   interpolated before refinement on the to-be-refined cell from the space of   the active finite element to the one of the future finite element. These   values are then distributed on the finite element spaces of the children   post-refinement. This may lose information if, for example, the old cell   used a Q2 space and the children use Q1 spaces, or the information may be   prolonged if the mother cell used a Q1 space and the children are Q2s.
* 

* 
* 
*  - If cells are to be coarsened, then the values from the child cells are   interpolated to the mother cell using the largest of the child cell future   finite element spaces, which will be identified as the least dominant   element following the FiniteElementDomination logic (consult    [2.x.43]  for more information). For   example, if the children of a cell use Q1, Q2 and Q3 spaces, then the   values from the children are interpolated into a Q3 space on the mother   cell. After refinement, this Q3 function on the mother cell is then   interpolated into the space the user has selected for this cell (which may   be different from Q3, in this example, if the user has set the   active FE index for a different space post-refinement and before calling    [2.x.44] 
* 

* 
*  [2.x.45]  In the context of hp-refinement, if cells are coarsened or the polynomial degree is lowered on some cells, then the old finite element space is not a subspace of the new space and you may run into the same situation as discussed above with hanging nodes. You may want to consider calling  [2.x.46]  on the vector obtained by transferring the solution.

* [0.x.22]*
   All cell data (the dof indices and the dof values) should be accessible   from each cell. As each cell has got only one  [2.x.68]  multiple   pointers to the data need to be packetized in a structure. Note that in   our case on each cell either the <tt>vector<unsigned int> indices</tt>   (if the cell will be refined) or the <tt>vector<double> dof_values</tt>   (if the children of this cell will be deleted) is needed, hence one  [2.x.69]    user_pointer should be sufficient, but to allow some error checks and to   preserve the user from making user errors the  [2.x.70]  will be   'multiplied' by this structure.
