[0.x.0]*
 Implement the limited memory BFGS minimization method.
*  This class implements a method to minimize a given function for which only the values of the function and its derivatives, but not its second derivatives are available. The BFGS method is a variation of the Newton method for function minimization in which the Hessian matrix is only approximated. In particular, the Hessian is updated using the formula of Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb, and Shanno (BFGS):

* 
* [1.x.0]
*  for a symmetric positive definite  [2.x.0] . Limited memory variant is implemented via the two-loop recursion.

* 
* [0.x.1]*
   Number type.  
* [0.x.2]*
   Standardized data struct to pipe additional data to the solver.  
* [0.x.3]*
     Constructor.    
* [0.x.4]*
     Maximum history size.    
* [0.x.5]*
     Print extra debug output to deallog.    
* [0.x.6]*
   Constructor.  
* [0.x.7]*
   Solve the unconstrained minimization problem   [1.x.1]   starting from initial state  [2.x.1]      The function  [2.x.2]  takes two arguments indicating the values of  [2.x.3]    and of the gradient  [2.x.4] . When called, it needs to update the gradient  [2.x.5]  at the given   location  [2.x.6]  and return the value of the function being minimized, i.e.,    [2.x.7] .  
* [0.x.8]*
   Connect a slot to perform a custom line-search.     Given the value of function  [2.x.8]  the current value of unknown  [2.x.9]    the gradient  [2.x.10]  and the search direction  [2.x.11]    return the size  [2.x.12]  of the step  [2.x.13] ,   and update  [2.x.14]   [2.x.15]  and  [2.x.16]  accordingly.  
* [0.x.9]*
   Connect a slot to perform a custom preconditioning.     The preconditioner is applied inside the two loop recursion to   vector `g` using the history of position increments `s` and   gradient increments `y`.     One possibility is to use the oldest `s,y` pair:  
* [1.x.2]
*      No preconditioning is performed if the code using this class has not   attached anything to the signal.  
* [0.x.10]*
   Additional data to the solver.  
* [0.x.11]*
   Signal used to perform line search.  
* [0.x.12]*
   Signal used to perform preconditioning.  
* [0.x.13]
