There are two reasons: the first one is that we do not just want to output the solution but also for each cell which processor owns it (i.e. which &quot;subdomain&quot; it is in). Secondly, as discussed at length in   @ref step_17 &quot;step-17&quot;   and   @ref step_18 &quot;step-18&quot;  , generating graphical data can be a bottleneck in parallelizing. In   @ref step_18 &quot;step-18&quot;  , we have moved this step out of the actual computation but shifted it into a separate program that later combined the output from various processors into a single file.

<div class="line"><a name="l00829"></a><span class="lineno">  829</span>&#160;<span class="stringliteral">*  The final function,   &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt;  , again has the same structure as in all other programs, in particular   @ref step_6 &quot;step-6&quot;  . Like the other programs that use MPI, we have to initialize and finalize MPI, which is done using the helper object   Utilities::MPI::MPI_InitFinalize.   The constructor of that class also initializes libraries that depend on MPI, such as p4est, PETSc, SLEPc, and Zoltan (though the last two are not used in this tutorial). The order here is important: we cannot use any of these libraries until they are initialized, so it does not make sense to do anything before creating an instance of   Utilities::MPI::MPI_InitFinalize.  </span></div>

This order is also important:   Utilities::MPI::MPI_InitFinalize::~MPI_InitFinalize()   calls   &lt;code&gt;PetscFinalize&lt;/code&gt;   (and finalization functions for other libraries), which will delete any in-use PETSc objects. This must be done after we destruct the Laplace solver to avoid double deletion errors. Fortunately, due to the order of destructor call rules of C++, we do not need to worry about any of this: everything happens in the correct order (i.e., the reverse of the order of construction). The last function called by   Utilities::MPI::MPI_InitFinalize::~MPI_InitFinalize()   is   &lt;code&gt;MPI_Finalize&lt;/code&gt;  : i.e., once this object is destructed the program should exit since MPI will no longer be available.</span></div>

class="ttdeci">if we even only hold bytes per line in this sparsity we ll need GB for this object even if every single line is empty Of only million lines will be non for which we need MB plus whatever is necessary to store the actual column indices of nonzero entries Let s say we have a moderately complex problem with entries per for each of which we store the column index worth then we ll need bytes for each of the million lines that correspond to the degrees of freedom we for a total of GB And we ll need bytes for each of the million lines that we don t for a total of GB It is clear that this ratio doesn t become any better if we go to even higher numbers of processors *The solution to this problem is to really only use any memory at all for those parts of the linear system that we or need for some other reason For all other we must know that they but we can not set up any part of our data structure To this there exists a class called IndexSet that denotes a set of indices which we care for and for which we may have to allocate memory The data structures for sparsity patterns constraint matrices matrices and vector can be initialized with these IndexSet objects to really only care for those rows or entries that correspond to indices in the index set and not care about all others These objects will then ask how many indices exist in the set allocate memory for each one of and when you want to access data for global degree of freedom[2.x.28] you will be redirected to the result of calling[2.x.29] with index[2.x.30] instead Accessing data for elements[2.x.31] for which[2.x.32] is false will yield an error *The remaining question is how to identify the set of indices that correspond to degrees of freedom we need to worry about on each processor To this you can use the[2.x.33] function to get at all the indices a processor owns Note that this is a subset of the degrees of freedom that are defined on the locally owned one sometimes needs the set of all degrees of freedom on the locally owned subdomain as well as the adjacent ghost cells This information is provided by the[2.x.35] function ***A typical parallel application is dealing with two different kinds of parallel but there are of course different vector types that can each represent both ghosted vectors are typically used for data error input in integration This is because in these one typically needs access not only to[2.x.39] locally owned dofs but also to[2.x.40] locally active dofs and sometimes to[2.x.41] locally relevant and their values may not be stored in non ghosted vectors on the processor that needs them The operations listed above also only require read only access to and ghosted vectors are therefore usable in these contexts *On the other vectors without ghost entries are used in all other places like or any other form of manipulation These are typically write only operations and therefore need not have read access to vector elements that may be owned by another processor *You can copy between vectors with and without ghost the only class equipped to deal with the situation just explained is DynamicSparsityPattern A version of the function[2.x.45] exists that takes an IndexSet argument that indicates which lines of the sparsity pattern to allocate memory for In other it is safe to create such an object that will report as its size but in fact only stores only as many rows as the index set has elements You can then use the usual function[2.x.46] to build the sparsity pattern that results from assembling on the locally owned portion of the mesh The resulting object can be used to initialize a PETSc or Trilinos matrix which support very large object sizes through completely distributed storage The matrix can then be assembled by only looping over those cells owned by the current processor *The only thing to pay attention to is for which degrees of freedom the sparsity needs to store entries These in the ones we could possibly store values to in the matrix upon assembly It is clear that these are certainly the locally active degrees of it may also be possible to write to entries that are located on ghost cells you need to pass the index set that results from[2.x.47] upon initializing the sparsity pattern ***When creating the sparsity pattern as well as when assembling the linear we need to know about constraints on degrees of for example resulting from hanging nodes or boundary conditions Like the DynamicSparsityPattern the AffineConstraints container can also take an IndexSet upon construction that indicates for which of the possibly very large number of degrees of freedom it should actually store constraints Unlike for the sparsity these are now only those degrees of freedom which we work on locally when namely those returned situations where more complicated constraints appear in finite element programs An example is in[2.x.49] adaptive computations where degrees of freedom can be constrained against other degrees of freedom that are themselves constrained In a case like in order to fully resolve this chain of it may not be sufficient to only store constraints on locally active degrees of freedom but one may also need to have constraints available on locally relevant ones In that the AffineConstraints object needs to be initialized with the IndexSet produced by *[2.x.50] In your program will continue to do something if you happen to not store all necessary constraints on each processor</div><div class="ttdef"><b>Definition:</b> <a
