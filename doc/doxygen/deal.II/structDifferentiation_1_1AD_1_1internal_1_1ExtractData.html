Then, we can write the simplified equation in coordinates as[1.x.12] We see, that this is just three copies of the bilinear form of the Laplacian, one applied to each component(this is where the formulation with the[2.x.33] is more exciting, and we want to derive a framework that applies to that one as well). We can make this weak form a system of differential equations again by choosing special test functions:first, choose[1.x.13]=([1.x.14]&lt; sub &gt;1&lt;/sub &gt;, 0, 0)&lt; sup &gt;T&lt;/sup &gt;, then[1.x.15]=(0, [1.x.16]&lt; sub &gt;2&lt;/sub &gt;, 0)&lt; sup &gt;T&lt;/sup &gt;, and finally[1.x.17]=(0, 0, [1.x.18]&lt; sub &gt;3&lt;/sub &gt;)&lt; sup &gt;T&lt;/sup &gt;. writing the outcomes below each other, we obtain the system[1.x.19] where we used the standard inner product notation[2.x.34] . It is important for our understanding, that we keep in mind that the latter form as a system of PDE is completely equivalent to the original definition of the bilinear form[1.x.20]([1.x.21], [1.x.22]), which does not immediately exhibit this system structure. Let us close by writing the full system of the elastic equation with symmetric gradient[1.x.23]:[1.x.24] Very formally, if we believe in operator valued matrices, we can rewrite this in the form[1.x.25]&lt; sup &gt;T&lt;/sup &gt;[1.x.26]=[1.x.27]&lt; sup &gt;T&lt;/sup &gt;[1.x.28] or[1.x.29] *[1.x.30] Now, let us consider a more complex example, the mixed Laplace equations discussed in[2.x.35] in three dimensions:[1.x.31] **Here, we have four solution components:the scalar pressure[2.x.36] and the vector-valued velocity[2.x.37] with three vector components. Note as important difference to the previous example, that the vector space[1.x.32] is not just simply a copy of three identical spaces/*A systematic way to get a weak or variational form for this and other vector problems is to first consider it as a problem where the operators and solution variables are written in vector and matrix form. For the example, this would read as follows:[1.x.33] **This makes it clear that the solution[1.x.34] *indeed has four components. We note that we could change the ordering of the solution components[2.x.38] and[2.x.39] inside[2.x.40] if we also change columns of the matrix operator.*Next, we need to think about test functions[2.x.41] . We want to multiply both sides of the equation with them, then integrate over[2.x.42] . The result should be a scalar equality. We can achieve this by choosing[2.x.43] also vector valued as[1.x.35] **It is convenient to multiply the matrix-vector equation by the test function from the left, since this way we automatically get the correct matrix later on(in the linear system, the matrix is also multiplied from the right with the solution variable, not from the left), whereas if we multiplied from the right then the matrix so assembled is the transpose of the one we really want. *With this in mind, let us multiply by[2.x.44] and integrate to get the following equation which has to hold for all test functions[2.x.45] :[1.x.36] *or equivalently:[1.x.37] ***We get the final form by integrating by part the second term:[1.x.38] **It is this form that we will later use in assembling the discrete weak form into a matrix and a right hand side vector:the form in which we have solution and test functions[2.x.46] that each consist of a number of vector components that we can extract. **[2.x.47] VVFEs[1.x.39] *Once we have settled on a bilinear form and a functional setting, we need to find a way to describe the vector-valued finite element spaces from which we draw solution and test functions. This is where the FESystem class comes in:it composes vector-valued finite element spaces from simpler ones. In the example of the elasticity problem, we need[2.x.48] copies of the same element, for instance **[1.x.40] *This will generate a vector valued space of dimension[2.x.49], where each component is a continuous bilinear element of type FE_Q. It will have[2.x.50] times as many basis functions as the corresponding FE_Q, and each of these basis functions is a basis function of FE_Q, lifted into one of the components of the vector. *For the mixed Laplacian, the situation is more complex. First, we have to settle on a pair of discrete spaces[2.x.51] . One option would be the stable Raviart-Thomas pair **[1.x.41] *The first element in this system is already a vector valued element of dimension[2.x.52], while the second is a regular scalar element. *Alternatively to using the stable Raviart-Thomas pair, we could consider a stabilized formulation for the mixed Laplacian, for instance the LDG method. There, we have the option of using the same spaces for velocity components and pressure, namely **[1.x.42] *This system just has[2.x.53] equal copies of the same discontinuous element, which not really reflects the structure of the system. Therefore, we prefer **[1.x.43] *Here, we have a system of two elements, one vector-valued and one scalar, very much like with the[2.x.54] . Indeed, in many codes, the two can be interchanged. This element also allows us easily to switch to an LDG method with lower order approximation in the velocity, namely **[1.x.44] *It must be pointed out, that this element is different from **[1.x.45] *While the constructor call is very similar to[2.x.55], the result actually resembles more[2.x.56] in that this element produces[2.x.57] independent components. A more detailed comparison of the resulting FESystem objects is below. *[1.x.46] *FESystem has a few internal variables which reflect the internal structure set up by the constructor. These can then also be used by application programs to give structure to matrix assembling and linear algebra. We give the names and values of these variables for the examples above in the following table:&lt; table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt; tr &gt;&lt; th &gt;System Element&lt;/th &gt;[2.x.58][2.x.59][2.x.60]&lt;/tr &gt;&lt; tr &gt;&lt; td &gt;[2.x.61]&lt;/td &gt;&lt; td &gt;1&lt;/td &gt;&lt;/tr &gt;&lt; tr &gt;&lt; td &gt;[2.x.62]&lt;/td &gt;&lt; td &gt;2&lt;/td &gt;&lt;/tr &gt;&lt; tr &gt;&lt; td &gt;[2.x.63]&lt;/td &gt;&lt; td &gt;2&lt;/td &gt;&lt;/tr &gt;&lt; tr &gt;&lt; td &gt;[2.x.64]&lt;/td &gt;&lt; td &gt;1&lt;/td &gt;&lt;/tr &gt;&lt; tr &gt;&lt; td &gt;[2.x.65]&lt;/td &gt;&lt; td &gt;2&lt;/td &gt;&lt;/tr &gt;&lt;/table &gt; *From this table, it is clear that the FESystem reflects a lot of the structure of the system of differential equations in the cases of the[2.x.66] and the[2.x.67], in that we have a vector valued and a scalar variable. On the other hand, the convoluted elements do not have this structure and we have to reconstruct it somehow when assembling systems, as described below. *At this point, it is important to note that nesting of two FESystem object can give the whole FESystem a richer structure than just concatenating them. This structure can be exploited by application programs, but is not automatically so. *[2.x.68] VVAssembling[1.x.47] The next step is to assemble the linear system. How to do this for the simple case of a scalar problem has been shown in many tutorial programs, starting with[2.x.69] . Here we will show how to do it for vector problems. Corresponding to the different characterizations of weak formulations above and the different system elements created, we have a few options which are outlined below. *The whole concept is probably best explained by showing an example illustrating how the local contribution of a cell to the weak form of above mixed Laplace equations could be assembled. *[1.x.48] This is essentially how[2.x.70] does it:**[1.x.49] **So here 's what is happening:[2.x.71][2.x.72] The first thing we do is to declare &quot;extractors&quot;(see the FEValuesExtractors namespace). These are objects that don 't do much except store which components of a vector-valued finite element constitute a single scalar component, or a tensor of rank 1(i.e. what we call a &quot;physical vector&quot;, always consisting of[2.x.73] components). Here, we declare an object that represents the velocities consisting of[2.x.74] components starting at component zero, and the extractor for the pressure, which is a scalar component at position[2.x.75] . *[2.x.76] We then do our usual loop over all cells, shape functions, and quadrature points. In the innermost loop, we compute the local contribution of a pair of shape functions to the global matrix and right hand side vector. Recall that the cell contributions to the bilinear form(i.e. neglecting boundary terms) looked as follows, based on shape functions[2.x.77] :[1.x.50] *whereas the implementation looked like this:*[1.x.51] *The similarities are pretty obvious. *[2.x.78] Essentially, what happens in above code is this:when you do[2.x.79], a so-called &quot;view&quot; is created, i.e. an object that unlike the full FEValues object represents not all components of a finite element, but only the one(s) represented by the extractor object[2.x.80] or[2.x.81] . *[2.x.82] These views can then be asked for information about these individual components. For example, when you write[2.x.83] you get the value of the pressure component of the[2.x.84] th shape function[2.x.85] at the[2.x.86] th quadrature point. Because the extractor[2.x.87] represents a scalar component, the results of the operator[2.x.88] is a scalar number. On the other hand, the call[2.x.89] would produce the value of a whole set of[2.x.90] components, which would be of type[2.x.91] . *[2.x.92] Other things that can be done with views is to ask for the gradient of a particular shape function 's components described by an extractor. For example,[2.x.93] would represent the gradient of the scalar pressure component, which is of type[2.x.94], whereas the gradient of the velocities components,[2.x.95] is a[2.x.96], i.e. a matrix[2.x.97] that consists of entries[2.x.98] . Finally, both scalar and vector views can be asked for the second derivatives(&quot;Hessians&quot;) and vector views can be asked for the symmetric gradient, defined as[2.x.99] as well as the divergence[2.x.100] .[2.x.101] Other examples of using extractors and views are shown in tutorial programs[2.x.102],[2.x.103],[2.x.104] and several other programs. ***[2.x.105] In the current context, when we talk about a vector(for example in extracting the velocity components above), we mean the word in the sense physics uses it:it has[2.x.106] components that behave in specific ways under coordinate system transformations. Examples include velocity or displacement fields. This is opposed to how mathematics uses the word &quot;vector&quot;(and how we use this word in other contexts in the library, for example in the Vector class), where it really stands for a collection of numbers. An example of this latter use of the word could be the set of concentrations of chemical species in a flame x</div><div class="ttdef"><b>Definition:</b> <a href="vector__valued__0_8txt_source.html#l00090">vector_valued_0.txt:90</a></div></div>
