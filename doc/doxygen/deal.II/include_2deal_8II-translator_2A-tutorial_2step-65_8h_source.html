efficient indexing schemes in case the underlying data structures allow for and to inform the access functions in[2.x.19] on which array to get the data from One example of more efficient storage is

interleaving between cells implies that only the batches for vectorization can be accessed whereas there is a strided access for getting only some of the entries The two additional categories interleaved_contiguous_strided and interleaved_contiguous_mixed_strides are a consequence of this storage type The former is for faces where at least one of the two adjacent sides will break with the interleaved storage We then have to make a strided access as described in the next category The last category interleaved_contiguous_mixed_strides appears in the ghost see the more detailed

for which[2.x.32] is false will yield an error *The remaining question is how to identify the set of indices that correspond to degrees of freedom we need to worry about on each processor To this you can use the[2.x.33] function to get at all the indices a processor owns Note that this is a subset of the degrees of freedom that are defined on the locally owned one sometimes needs the set of all

different kinds of parallel but there are of course different vector types that can each represent both ghosted vectors are typically used for data error input in integration This is because in these one typically needs access not only to[2.x.39] locally owned dofs but also to[2.x.40] locally active dofs and sometimes to[2.x.41] locally relevant and their values may not be stored in non ghosted vectors on the processor that needs them The operations listed above also only require read only access to and ghosted vectors are therefore usable in these contexts *On the other vectors without ghost entries are used in all other places like or any other form of manipulation These are typically write only operations and therefore need not have read access to vector elements that may be owned by another processor *You can copy between vectors with and without ghost the only class equipped to deal with the situation just explained is DynamicSparsityPattern A version of the function[2.x.45] exists that takes an IndexSet argument that indicates which lines of the sparsity pattern to allocate memory for In other it is safe to create such an object that will report as its size but in fact only stores only as many rows as the index set has elements You can then use the usual function[2.x.46] to build the sparsity pattern that results from assembling on the locally owned portion of the mesh The resulting object can be used to initialize a PETSc or Trilinos matrix which support very large object sizes through completely distributed storage The matrix can then be assembled by only looping over those cells owned by the current processor *The only thing to pay attention to is for which degrees of freedom the sparsity needs to store entries These in the ones we could possibly store values to in the matrix upon assembly It is clear that these are certainly the locally active degrees of it may also be possible to write to entries that are located on ghost cells you need to pass the index set that results from[2.x.47] upon initializing the sparsity pattern ***When creating the sparsity pattern as well as when assembling the linear we need to know about constraints on degrees of for example resulting from hanging nodes or boundary conditions Like the DynamicSparsityPattern the AffineConstraints container can also take an IndexSet upon construction that indicates for which of the possibly very large number of degrees of freedom it should actually store constraints Unlike for the sparsity these are now only those degrees of freedom which we work on locally when namely those returned situations where more complicated constraints appear in finite element programs An example is in[2.x.49] adaptive computations where degrees of freedom can be constrained against other degrees of freedom that are themselves constrained In a case like in order to fully resolve this chain of it may not be sufficient to only store constraints on locally active degrees of freedom but one may also need to have constraints available on locally relevant ones In that the AffineConstraints object needs to be initialized with the IndexSet produced by *[2.x.50] In your program will continue to do something if you happen to not store all necessary constraints on each but the program will not abort This is opposed to the situation of the sparsity if the IndexSet passed to the DynamicSparsityPattern indicates that it should store too few rows of the the program will either abort when you attempt to write into matrix entries that do not exist or the matrix class will silently allocate more memory to accommodate them As a consequence it is useful to err on the side of caution when indicating which constraints to store and use the result of[2.x.51] rather

Then, we can write the simplified equation in coordinates as[1.x.12] We see, that this is just three copies of the bilinear form of the Laplacian, one applied to each component(this is where the formulation with the[2.x.33] is more exciting, and we want to derive a framework that applies to that one as well). We can make this weak form a system of differential equations again by choosing special test functions:first, choose[1.x.13]=([1.x.14]&lt; sub &gt;1&lt;/sub &gt;, 0, 0)&lt; sup &gt;T&lt;/sup &gt;, then[1.x.15]=(0, [1.x.16]&lt; sub &gt;2&lt;/sub &gt;, 0)&lt; sup &gt;T&lt;/sup &gt;, and finally[1.x.17]=(0, 0, [1.x.18]&lt; sub &gt;3&lt;/sub &gt;)&lt; sup &gt;T&lt;/sup &gt;. writing the outcomes below each other, we obtain the system[1.x.19] where we used the standard inner product notation[2.x.34] . It is important for our understanding, that we keep in mind that the latter form as a system of PDE is completely equivalent to the original definition of the bilinear form[1.x.20]([1.x.21], [1.x.22]), which does not immediately exhibit this system structure. Let us close by writing the full system of the elastic equation with symmetric gradient[1.x.23]:[1.x.24] Very formally, if we believe in operator valued matrices, we can rewrite this in the form[1.x.25]&lt; sup &gt;T&lt;/sup &gt;[1.x.26]=[1.x.27]&lt; sup &gt;T&lt;/sup &gt;[1.x.28] or[1.x.29] *[1.x.30] Now, let us consider a more complex example, the mixed Laplace equations discussed in[2.x.35] in three dimensions:[1.x.31] **Here, we have four solution components:the scalar pressure[2.x.36] and the vector-valued velocity[2.x.37] with three vector components. Note as important difference to the previous example, that the vector space[1.x.32] is not just simply a copy of three identical spaces/*A systematic way to get a weak or variational form for this and other vector problems is to first consider it as a problem where the operators and solution variables are written in vector and matrix form. For the example, this would read as follows:[1.x.33] **This makes it clear that the solution[1.x.34] *indeed has four components. We note that we could change the ordering of the solution components[2.x.38] and[2.x.39] inside[2.x.40] if we also change columns of the matrix operator.*Next, we need to think about test functions[2.x.41] . We want to multiply both sides of the equation with them, then integrate over[2.x.42] . The result should be a scalar equality. We can achieve this by choosing[2.x.43] also vector valued as[1.x.35] **It is convenient to multiply the matrix-vector equation by the test function from the left, since this way we automatically get the correct matrix later on(in the linear system, the matrix is also multiplied from the right with the solution variable, not from the left), whereas if we multiplied from the right then the matrix so assembled is the transpose of the one we really want. *With this in mind, let us multiply by[2.x.44] and integrate to get the following equation which has to hold for all test functions[2.x.45] :[1.x.36] *or equivalently:[1.x.37] ***We get the final form by integrating by part the second term:[1.x.38] **It is this form that we will later use in assembling the discrete weak form into a matrix and a right hand side vector:the form in which we have solution and test functions[2.x.46] that each consist of a number of vector components that we can extract. **[2.x.47] VVFEs[1.x.39] *Once we have settled on a bilinear form and a functional setting, we need to find a way to describe the vector-valued finite element spaces from which we draw solution and test functions. This is where the FESystem class comes in:it composes vector-valued finite element spaces from simpler ones. In the example of the elasticity problem, we need[2.x.48] copies of the same element, for instance **[1.x.40] *This will generate a vector valued space of dimension[2.x.49], where each component is a continuous bilinear element of type FE_Q. It will have[2.x.50] times as many basis functions as the corresponding FE_Q, and each of these basis functions is a basis function of FE_Q, lifted into one of the components of the vector. *For the mixed Laplacian, the situation is more complex. First, we have to settle on a pair of discrete spaces[2.x.51] . One option would be the stable Raviart-Thomas pair **[1.x.41] *The first element in this system is already a vector valued element of dimension[2.x.52], while the second is a regular scalar element. *Alternatively to using the stable Raviart-Thomas pair, we could consider a stabilized formulation for the mixed Laplacian, for instance the LDG method. There, we have the option of using the same spaces for velocity components and pressure, namely **[1.x.42] *This system just has[2.x.53] equal copies of the same discontinuous element, which not really reflects the structure of the system. Therefore, we prefer **[1.x.43] *Here, we have a system of two elements, one vector-valued and one scalar, very much like with the[2.x.54] . Indeed, in many codes, the two can be interchanged. This element also allows us easily to switch to an LDG method with lower order approximation in the velocity, namely **[1.x.44] *It must be pointed out, that this element is different from **[1.x.45] *While the constructor call is very similar to[2.x.55], the result actually resembles more[2.x.56] in that this element produces[2.x.57] independent components. A more detailed comparison of the resulting FESystem objects is below. *[1.x.46] *FESystem has a few internal variables which reflect the internal structure set up by the constructor. These can then also be used by application programs to give structure to matrix assembling and linear algebra. We give the names and values of these variables for the examples above in the following table:&lt; table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt; tr &gt;&lt; th &gt;System Element&lt;/th &gt;[2.x.58][2.x.59][2.x.60]&lt;/tr &gt;&lt; tr &gt;&lt; td &gt;[2.x.61]&lt;/td &gt;&lt; td &gt;1&lt;/td &gt;&lt;/tr &gt;&lt; tr &gt;&lt; td &gt;[2.x.62]&lt;/td &gt;&lt; td &gt;2&lt;/td &gt;&lt;/tr &gt;&lt; tr &gt;&lt; td &gt;[2.x.63]&lt;/td &gt;&lt; td &gt;2&lt;/td &gt;&lt;/tr &gt;&lt; tr &gt;&lt; td &gt;[2.x.64]&lt;/td &gt;&lt; td &gt;1&lt;/td &gt;&lt;/tr &gt;&lt; tr &gt;&lt; td &gt;[2.x.65]&lt;/td &gt;&lt; td &gt;2&lt;/td &gt;&lt;/tr &gt;&lt;/table &gt; *From this table, it is clear that the FESystem reflects a lot of the structure of the system of differential equations in the cases of the[2.x.66] and the[2.x.67], in that we have a vector valued and a scalar variable. On the other hand, the convoluted elements do not have this structure and we have to reconstruct it somehow when assembling systems, as described below. *At this point, it is important to note that nesting of two FESystem object can give the whole FESystem a richer structure than just concatenating them. This structure can be exploited by application programs, but is not automatically so. *[2.x.68] VVAssembling[1.x.47] The next step is to assemble the linear system. How to do this for the simple case of a scalar problem has been shown in many tutorial programs, starting with[2.x.69] . Here we will show how to do it for vector problems. Corresponding to the different characterizations of weak formulations above and the different system elements created, we have a few options which are outlined below. *The whole concept is probably best explained by showing an example illustrating how the local contribution of a cell to the weak form of above mixed Laplace equations could be assembled. *[1.x.48] This is essentially how[2.x.70] does it:**[1.x.49] **So here 's what is happening:[2.x.71][2.x.72] The first thing we do is to declare &quot;extractors&quot;(see the FEValuesExtractors namespace). These are objects that don 't do much except store which components of a vector-valued finite element constitute a single scalar component, or a tensor of rank 1(i.e. what we call a &quot;physical vector&quot;, always consisting of[2.x.73] components). Here, we declare an object that represents the velocities consisting of[2.x.74] components starting at component zero, and the extractor for the pressure, which is a scalar component at position[2.x.75] . *[2.x.76] We then do our usual loop over all cells, shape functions, and quadrature points. In the innermost loop, we compute the local contribution of a pair of shape functions to the global matrix and right hand side vector. Recall that the cell contributions to the bilinear form(i.e. neglecting boundary terms) looked as follows, based on shape functions[2.x.77] :[1.x.50] *whereas the implementation looked like this:*[1.x.51] *The similarities are pretty obvious. *[2.x.78] Essentially, what happens in above code is this:when you do[2.x.79], a so-called &quot;view&quot; is created, i.e. an object that unlike the full FEValues object represents not all components of a finite element, but only the one(s) represented by the extractor object[2.x.80] or[2.x.81] . *[2.x.82] These views can then be asked for information about these individual components. For example, when you write[2.x.83] you get the value of the pressure component of the[2.x.84] th shape function[2.x.85] at the[2.x.86] th quadrature point. Because the extractor[2.x.87] represents a scalar component, the results of the operator[2.x.88] is a scalar number. On the other hand, the call[2.x.89] would produce the value of a whole set of[2.x.90] components, which would be of type[2.x.91] . *[2.x.92] Other things that can be done with views is to ask for the gradient of a particular shape function 's components described by an extractor. For example,[2.x.93] would represent the gradient of the scalar pressure component, which is of type[2.x.94], whereas the gradient of the velocities components,[2.x.95] is a[2.x.96], i.e. a matrix[2.x.97] that consists of entries[2.x.98] . Finally, both scalar and vector views can be asked for the second derivatives(&quot;Hessians&quot;) and vector views can be asked for the symmetric gradient, defined as[2.x.99] as well as the divergence[2.x.100] .[2.x.101] Other examples of using extractors and views are shown in tutorial programs[2.x.102],[2.x.103],[2.x.104] and several other programs. ***[2.x.105] In the current context, when we talk about a vector(for example in extracting the velocity components above), we mean the word in the sense physics uses it:it has[2.x.106] components that behave in specific ways under coordinate system transformations. Examples include velocity or displacement fields. This is opposed to how mathematics uses the word &quot;vector&quot;(and how we use this word in other contexts in the library, for example in the Vector class), where it really stands for a collection of numbers. An example of this latter use of the word could be the set of concentrations of chemical species in a flame x</div><div class="ttdef"><b>Definition:</b> <a href="vector__valued__0_8txt_source.html#l00090">vector_valued_0.txt:90</a></div></div>

whatever is necessary to store the actual column indices of nonzero entries Let s say we have a moderately complex problem with entries per for each of which we store the column index worth then we ll need bytes for each of the million lines that correspond to the degrees of freedom we for a total of GB And we ll need bytes for each of the million lines that we don t for a total of GB It is clear that this ratio doesn t become any better if we go to even higher numbers of processors *The solution to this problem is to really only use any memory at all for those parts of the linear system that we or need for some other reason For all other we must know that they but we can not set up any part of our data structure To this there exists a class called IndexSet that denotes a set of indices which we care for and for which we may have to allocate memory The data structures for sparsity patterns constraint matrices matrices and vector can be initialized with these IndexSet objects to really only care for those rows or entries that correspond to indices in the index set and not care about all others These objects will then ask how many indices exist in the set allocate memory for each one of and when you want to access data for global degree of freedom[2.x.28] you will be redirected to the result of calling[2.x.29] with index[2.x.30] instead Accessing data for elements[2.x.31] for which[2.x.32] is false will yield an error *The remaining question is how to identify the set of indices that correspond to degrees of freedom we need to worry about on each processor To this you can use the[2.x.33] function to get at all the indices a processor owns Note that this is a subset of the degrees of freedom that are defined on the locally owned one sometimes needs the set of all degrees of freedom on the locally owned subdomain as well as the adjacent ghost cells This information is provided by the[2.x.35] function ***A typical parallel application is dealing with two different kinds of parallel but there are of course different vector types that can each represent both ghosted vectors are typically used for data error input in integration This is because in these one typically needs access not only to[2.x.39] locally owned dofs but also to[2.x.40] locally active dofs and sometimes to[2.x.41] locally relevant and their values may not be stored in non ghosted vectors on the processor that needs them The operations listed above also only require read only access to and ghosted vectors are therefore usable in these contexts *On the other vectors without ghost entries are used in all other places like or any other form of manipulation These are typically write only operations and therefore need not have read access to vector elements that may be owned by another processor *You can copy between vectors with and without ghost the only class equipped to deal with the situation just explained is DynamicSparsityPattern A version of the function[2.x.45] exists that takes an IndexSet argument that indicates which lines of the sparsity pattern to allocate memory for In other it is safe to create such an object that will report as its size but in fact only stores only as many rows as the index set has elements You can then use the usual function[2.x.46] to build the sparsity pattern that results from assembling on the locally owned portion of the mesh The resulting object can be used to initialize a PETSc or Trilinos matrix which support very large object sizes through completely distributed storage The matrix can then be assembled by only looping over those cells owned by the current processor *The only thing to pay attention to is for which degrees of freedom the sparsity needs to store entries These in the ones we could possibly store values to in the matrix upon assembly It is clear that these are certainly the locally active degrees of it may also be possible to write to entries that are located on ghost cells you need to pass the index set that results from[2.x.47] upon initializing the sparsity pattern ***When creating the sparsity pattern as well as when assembling the linear we need to know about constraints on degrees of for example resulting from hanging nodes or boundary conditions Like the DynamicSparsityPattern the AffineConstraints container can also take an IndexSet upon construction that indicates for which of the possibly very large number of degrees of freedom it should actually store constraints Unlike for the sparsity these are now only those degrees of freedom which we work on locally when namely those returned situations where more complicated constraints appear in finite element programs An example is in[2.x.49] adaptive computations where degrees of freedom can be constrained against other degrees of freedom that are themselves constrained In a case like in order to fully resolve this chain of it may not be sufficient to only store constraints on locally active degrees of freedom but one may also need to have constraints available on locally relevant ones In that the AffineConstraints object needs to be initialized with the IndexSet produced by *[2.x.50] In your program will

For example, in[2.x.16](and other tutorial programs), we want to consider the global linear system[2.x.17] in the form[1.x.4] *where[2.x.18] are the values of velocity and pressure degrees of freedom, respectively,[2.x.19] is the mass matrix on the velocity space,[2.x.20] corresponds to the negative divergence operator,and[2.x.21] is its transpose and corresponds to the negative gradient. *Using such a decomposition into blocks, one can then define preconditioners that are based on the individual operators that are present in a system of equations(for example the Schur complement, in the case of[2.x.22]), rather than the entire matrix. In essence, blocks are used to reflect the structure of a PDE system in linear algebra, in particular allowing for modular solvers for problems with multiple solution components. On the other hand, the matrix and right hand side vector can also treated as a unit, which is convenient for example during assembly of the linear system when one may not want to make a distinction between the individual components, or for an outer Krylov space solver that doesn 't care about the block structure(e.g. if only the preconditioner needs the block structure). *Splitting matrices and vectors into blocks is supported by the BlockSparseMatrix, BlockVector, and related classes. See the overview of the various linear algebra classes in the[2.x.23] module. The objects present two interfaces:one that makes the object look like a matrix or vector with global indexing operations, and one that makes the object look like a collection of sub-blocks that can be individually addressed. Depending on context, one may wish to use one or the other interface. *Typically, one defines the sub-structure of a matrix or vector by grouping the degrees of freedom that make up groups of physical quantities(for example all velocities) into individual blocks of the linear system. This is defined in more detail below in the glossary entry on[2.x.24] &quot;Block (finite element)&quot;.[2.x.25] **&lt; dt class=&quot;glossary&quot;&gt;[2.x.26] GlossBlock[1.x.5]&lt;/dt &gt;[2.x.27][1.x.6] Blocks are a generalization of[2.x.28] &quot;components&quot; in that they group together one or more components of a vector-valued finite element that one would like to consider jointly. One often wants to do this to define operators that correspond to the structure of a(part of a) differential operator acting on the vector-valued solution, such as the Schur complement solver in[2.x.29], or the block solvers and preconditioners of[2.x.30] . *For the purpose of a discretization, blocks are the better concept to use since it is not always possible to address individual components of a solution. This is, in particular, the case for non-[2.x.31] GlossPrimitive &quot;primitive&quot; elements. Take for instance the solution of the mixed Laplacian system with the FE_RaviartThomas element(see[2.x.32]). There, the first&lt; tt &gt;dim&lt;/tt &gt; components are the directional velocities. Since the shape functions are linear combinations of those, these&lt; tt &gt;dim&lt;/tt &gt; components constitute only a single block. On the other hand, the pressure variable is scalar and would form a the second block, but in the&lt; tt &gt;dim+1&lt;/tt &gt;st component. *The minimal size of each block is dictated by the underlying finite element(a block consists of a single component for scalar elements, but in the case of the FE_RaviartThomas, for example, a block consists of&lt; tt &gt;dim&lt;/tt &gt; components). However, several such minimal blocks can be grouped together into user defined blocks at will, and in accordance with the application. For instance, for the[1.x.7]&lt; sub &gt;2&lt;/sub &gt;&lt; sup &gt;[1.x.8]&lt;/sup &gt; -[1.x.9]&lt; sub &gt;1&lt;/sub &gt;(Taylor-Hood) Stokes element, there are[1.x.10]+1 components each of which could in principle form its own block. But we are typically more interested in having only two blocks, one of which consists of all the velocity vector components(i.e. this block would have[1.x.11] components) and the other having only the single pressure component. *[1.x.12] deal.II has a number of different finite element classes, all of which are derived from the FiniteElement base class(see the[2.x.33] &quot;module on finite element classes&quot;). With one exception, whether they are scalar or vector valued, they all define a single block:all vector components the finite element defines through its[2.x.34] function form a single block, i.e.[2.x.35] returns one. *The exception is the FESystem class that takes multiple simpler elements and connects them into more complicated ones. Consequently, it can have more than one block. A FESystem has as many blocks as it has base elements times their multiplicity(see the constructors of FESystem to understand this statement). In other words, it does not care how many blocks each base element has, and consequently you can produce a Stokes element that has only two blocks by creating the object **[1.x.13] *On the other hand, we could have produced a similar object with dim+1 blocks using **[1.x.14] *With the exception of the number of blocks, the two objects are the same for all practical purposes, however. *[1.x.15] While we have defined blocks above in terms of the vector components of a vector-valued solution function(or, equivalently, in terms of the vector-valued finite element space), every shape function of a finite element is part of one block or another. Consequently, we can partition all degrees of freedom defined on a DoFHandler into individual blocks. Since by default the DoFHandler class enumerates degrees of freedom in a more or less random way, you will first want to call the[2.x.36] function to make sure that all degrees of freedom that correspond to a single block are enumerated consecutively. *If you do this, you naturally partition matrices and vectors into blocks as well(see[2.x.37] &quot;block (linear algebra)). In most cases, when you subdivide a matrix or vector into blocks, you do so by creating one block for each block defined by the finite element (i.e. in most practical cases the FESystem object). However, this needs not be so: the [2.x.38] function allows to group several vector components or finite element blocks into the same logical block (see, for example, the [2.x.39] &quot;[2.x.40] &quot; or [2.x.41] tutorial programs, as opposed to [2.x.42] ). As a consequence, using this feature, we can achieve the same result, i.e. subdividing matrices into [2.x.43] blocks and vectors into 2 blocks, for the second way of creating a Stokes element outlined above using an extra argument as we would have using the first way of creating the Stokes element with two blocks right away. * More information on this topic can be found in the documentation of FESystem, the [2.x.44] module and the tutorial programs referenced therein. * [1.x.16] Many functions allow you to restrict their operation to certain vector components or blocks. For example, this is the case for the functions that interpolate boundary values: one may want to only interpolate the boundary values for the velocity block of a finite element field but not the pressure block. The way to do this is by passing a BlockMask argument to such functions, see the [2.x.45] &quot;block mask entry of this glossary&quot;. [2.x.46] * * &lt;dt class=&quot;glossary&quot;&gt; [2.x.47] GlossBlockMask [1.x.17]&lt;/dt&gt; * [2.x.48] In much the same way as one can think of elements as being composed of physical vector components (see [2.x.49] ) or logical blocks (see [2.x.50] ), there is frequently a need to select a set of such blocks for operations that are not intended to be run on [1.x.18] blocks of a finite element space. Selecting which blocks to work on happens using the BlockMask class. * Block masks work in much the same way as component masks, including the fact that the BlockMask class has similar semantics to the ComponentMask class. See [2.x.51] &quot;the glossary entry on component masks&quot; for more information. * * * [2.x.52] While components and blocks provide two alternate but equally valid viewpoints on finite elements with multiple vector components, the fact is that throughout the library there are far more places where you can pass a ComponentMask argument rather than a BlockMask argument. Fortunately, one can be converted into the other, using the syntax [2.x.53] is a variable of type BlockMask. In other words, if you have a block mask but need to call a function that only accepts a component mask, this syntax can be used to obtain the necessary component mask. * [1.x.19] Block masks are typically created by asking the finite element to generate a block mask from certain selected vector components using code such as this where we create a mask that only denotes the velocity components of a Stokes element (see [2.x.54] ): * * [1.x.20] * The result is a block mask that, in 1d as well as 2d and 3d, would have values [2.x.55] . Similarly, using * * [1.x.21] * would result in a mask [2.x.56] in any dimension. * Note, however, that if we had defined the finite element in the following way: * * [1.x.22] * then the code * * [1.x.23] * would yield a block mask that in 2d has elements [2.x.57] because the element has [2.x.58] components and equally many blocks. See the discussion on what a block represents exactly in the [2.x.59] &quot;block entry of this glossary&quot;. [2.x.60] * * &lt;dt class=&quot;glossary&quot;&gt; [2.x.61] GlossBoundaryForm [1.x.24]&lt;/dt&gt; * [2.x.62] For a dim-dimensional triangulation in dim-dimensional space, the boundary form is a vector defined on faces. It is the vector product of the image of coordinate vectors on the surface of the unit cell. It is a vector normal to the surface, pointing outwards and having the length of the surface element. * A more general definition would be that (at least up to the length of this vector) it is exactly that vector that is necessary when considering integration by parts, i.e. equalities of the form [2.x.63] . Using this definition then also explains what this vector should be in the case of domains (and corresponding triangulations) of dimension [2.x.64] that are embedded in a space [2.x.65] : in that case, the boundary form is still a vector defined on the faces of the triangulation class</div><div class="ttdef"><b>Definition:</b> <a href="glossary__0_8txt_source.html#l00069">glossary_0.txt:69</a></div></div>

By default, DataOutBase and the classes that build on it output data at each corner of each cell. This means that data is output multiple times for each vertex of the mesh. The purpose of this scheme is to support output of discontinuous quantities, either because the finite element space is discontinuous or because the quantity that is output is computed from a solution field and is discontinuous across faces. This class is an attempt to rein in the amount of data that is written. If the fields that are written to files are indeed discontinuous, the only way to faithfully represent them is indeed to write multiple values for each vertex(this is typically done by writing multiple node locations for the same vertex and defining data at these nodes). However, for fine meshes, one may not necessarily be interested in an exact representation of output fields that will likely only have small discontinuities. Rather, it may be sufficient to just output one value per vertex, which may be chosen arbitrarily from among those that are defined at this vertex from any of the adjacent cells. *[0.x.123] *Default constructor. *[0.x.124] *Destructor with a given set of flags.

To tweak the I/O performance, especially for parallel I/O, the user may define the optional parameter[2.x.191] All MPI processes need to call the function with the same value.

The SVD is written as[2.x.215] with[2.x.216] as a diagonal matrix,[2.x.217] and[2.x.218] as orthogonal matrices. The diagonal elements of[2.x.219] are the singular values of[2.x.220] and the columns of[2.x.221] and[2.x.222] are the corresponding left and right singular vectors, respectively. The singular values are returned in decreasing order and only the first[2.x.223] columns of[2.x.224] and rows of[2.x.225] are computed. Upon return the content of the matrix is unusable. The matrix[2.x.226] must have identical block cyclic distribution for the rows and column. If left singular vectors are required matrices[2.x.227] and[2.x.228] have to be constructed with the same process grid and block cyclic distribution. If right singular vectors are required matrices[2.x.229] and[2.x.230] have to be constructed with the same process grid and block cyclic distribution. To avoid computing the left and/or right singular vectors the function accepts[2.x.231] for[2.x.232] and/or[2.x.233] *[0.x.36] *Solving overdetermined or underdetermined real linear systems involving matrix[2.x.234], or its transpose[2.x.235], using a QR or LQ factorization of[2.x.236] for[2.x.237] RHS vectors in the columns of matrix[2.x.238] It is assumed that[2.x.239] has full rank:[2.x.240] . The following options are supported:********- If(!transpose) and[2.x.241] :least squares solution of overdetermined system[2.x.242] .\n Upon exit the rows[2.x.243] to[2.x.244] of[2.x.245] contain the least square solution vectors.

Unlike the inverse, the pseudoinverse[2.x.267] exists for both rectangular as well as singular matrices[2.x.268] . For a rectangular[2.x.269] the pseudoinverse is computed by taking the reciprocal of each non-zero element on the diagonal, leaving the zeros in place, and then transposing[2.x.270] . For the numerical computation only the singular values[2.x.271] are taken into account. Upon successful exit, the function returns the number of singular values fulfilling that condition. That value can be interpreted as the rank of[2.x.272] . Upon return this object contains the pseudoinverse[2.x.273] .
