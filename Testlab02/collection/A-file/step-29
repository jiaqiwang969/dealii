<h1>Introduction</h1>


A question that comes up frequently is how to solve problems involving complex
valued functions with deal.II. For many problems, instead of working with
complex valued finite elements directly, it is often more convenient to split complex valued
functions into their real and imaginary parts and use separate scalar finite
element fields for discretizing each one of them. Basically this amounts to
viewing a single complex valued equation as a system of two real valued
equations. This short example demonstrates how this can be implemented in
deal.II by using an <code>FE_system</code> object to stack two finite element
fields representing real and imaginary parts. (The opposite approach,
keeping everything complex-valued, is demonstrated in a different
tutorial program: see step-58 for this.)
When split into real and imaginary parts, the equations covered here
fall into the class of vector-valued problems. A toplevel overview of
this topic can be found in the @ref vector_valued module.

In addition to this discussion, we also discuss the ParameterHandler
class, which provides a convenient way for reading parameters from a
configuration file at runtime without the need to recompile the
program code.


<h3>Problem setting</h3>

The original purpose of this program is to simulate the focusing properties
of an ultrasound wave generated by a transducer lens with variable
geometry. Recent applications in medical imaging use ultrasound waves not only
for imaging purposes, but also to excite certain local effects in a
material, like changes in optical properties, that can then be measured by
other imaging techniques. A vital ingredient for these methods is the ability
to focus the intensity of the ultrasound wave in a particular part of the
material, ideally in a point, to be able to examine the properties of the
material at that particular location.

To derive a model for this problem, we think of ultrasound as a pressure wave
governed by the wave equation:
@f[
	\frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial t^2}	-	c^2 \Delta U = 0
@f]
where $c$ is the wave speed (that for simplicity we assume to be constant), $U
= U(x,t),\;x \in \Omega,\;t\in\mathrm{R}$. The boundary
$\Gamma=\partial\Omega$ is divided into two parts $\Gamma_1$ and
$\Gamma_2=\Gamma\setminus\Gamma_1$, with $\Gamma_1$ representing the
transducer lens and $\Gamma_2$ an absorbing boundary (that is, we want to
choose boundary conditions on $\Gamma_2$ in such a way that they imitate a
larger domain). On $\Gamma_1$, the transducer generates a wave of constant
frequency ${\omega}>0$ and constant amplitude (that we chose to be 1 here):
@f[
U(x,t) = \cos{\omega t}, \qquad x\in \Gamma_1
@f]

If there are no other (interior or boundary) sources, and since the only
source has frequency $\omega$, then the solution admits a separation of
variables of the form $U(x,t) = \textrm{Re}\left(u(x)\,e^{i\omega
t})\right)$. The complex-valued function $u(x)$ describes the spatial
dependency of amplitude and phase (relative to the source) of the waves of
frequency ${\omega}$, with the amplitude being the quantity that we are
interested in. By plugging this form of the solution into the wave equation,
we see that for $u$ we have
@f{eqnarray*}
-\omega^2 u(x) - c^2\Delta u(x) &=& 0, \qquad x\in\Omega,\\
u(x) &=& 1,  \qquad x\in\Gamma_1.
@f}

For finding suitable conditions on $\Gamma_2$ that model an absorbing
boundary, consider a wave of the form $V(x,t)=e^{i(k\cdot x -\omega t)}$ with
frequency ${\omega}$ traveling in direction $k\in {\mathrm{R}^2}$. In order
for $V$ to solve the wave equation, $|k|={\frac{\omega}{c}}$ must
hold. Suppose that this wave hits the boundary in $x_0\in\Gamma_2$ at a right
angle, i.e. $n=\frac{k}{|k|}$ with $n$ denoting the outer unit normal of
$\Omega$ in $x_0$. Then at $x_0$, this wave satisfies the equation
@f[
c (n\cdot\nabla V) + \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} = (i\, c\, |k| - i\, \omega) V = 0.
@f]
Hence, by enforcing the boundary condition
@f[
c (n\cdot\nabla U) + \frac{\partial U}{\partial t} = 0, \qquad x\in\Gamma_2,
@f]
waves that hit the boundary $\Gamma_2$ at a right angle will be perfectly
absorbed. On the other hand, those parts of the wave field that do not hit a
boundary at a right angle do not satisfy this condition and enforcing it as a
boundary condition will yield partial reflections, i.e. only parts of the wave
will pass through the boundary as if it wasn't here whereas the remaining
fraction of the wave will be reflected back into the domain.

If we are willing to accept this as a sufficient approximation to an absorbing
boundary we finally arrive at the following problem for $u$:
@f{eqnarray*}
-\omega^2 u - c^2\Delta u &=& 0, \qquad x\in\Omega,\\
c (n\cdot\nabla u) + i\,\omega\,u &=&0, \qquad x\in\Gamma_2,\\
u &=& 1,  \qquad x\in\Gamma_1.
@f}
This is a Helmholtz equation (similar to the one in step-7, but this time with
''the bad sign'') with Dirichlet data on $\Gamma_1$ and mixed boundary
conditions on $\Gamma_2$. Because of the condition on $\Gamma_2$, we cannot just
treat the equations for real and imaginary parts of $u$ separately. What we can
do however is to view the PDE for $u$ as a system of two PDEs for the real and
imaginary parts of $u$, with the boundary condition on $\Gamma_2$ representing
the coupling terms between the two components of the system. This works along
the following lines: Let $v=\textrm{Re}\;u,\; w=\textrm{Im}\;u$, then in terms
of $v$ and $w$ we have the following system:
@f{eqnarray*}
  \left.\begin{array}{ccc}
    -\omega^2 v - c^2\Delta v &=& 0 \quad\\
    -\omega^2 w - c^2\Delta w &=& 0 \quad
  \end{array}\right\} &\;& x\in\Omega,
	\\
  \left.\begin{array}{ccc}
    c (n\cdot\nabla v) - \omega\,w &=& 0 \quad\\
    c (n\cdot\nabla w) + \omega\,v &=& 0 \quad
  \end{array}\right\} &\;& x\in\Gamma_2,
	\\
	\left.\begin{array}{ccc}
    v &=& 1 \quad\\
    w &=& 0 \quad
  \end{array}\right\} &\;& x\in\Gamma_1.
@f}

For test functions $\phi,\psi$ with $\phi|_{\Gamma_1}=\psi|_{\Gamma_1}=0$, after
the usual multiplication, integration over $\Omega$ and applying integration by
parts, we get the weak formulation
@f{eqnarray*}
-\omega^2 \langle \phi, v \rangle_{\mathrm{L}^2(\Omega)}
+ c^2 \langle \nabla \phi, \nabla v \rangle_{\mathrm{L}^2(\Omega)}
- c \omega \langle \phi, w \rangle_{\mathrm{L}^2(\Gamma_2)} &=& 0, \\
-\omega^2 \langle \psi, w \rangle_{\mathrm{L}^2(\Omega)}
+ c^2 \langle \nabla \psi, \nabla w \rangle_{\mathrm{L}^2(\Omega)}
+ c \omega \langle \psi, v \rangle_{\mathrm{L}^2(\Gamma_2)} &=& 0.
@f}

We choose finite element spaces $V_h$ and $W_h$ with bases $\{\phi_j\}_{j=1}^n,
\{\psi_j\}_{j=1}^n$ and look for approximate solutions
@f[
v_h = \sum_{j=1}^n \alpha_j \phi_j, \;\; w_h = \sum_{j=1}^n \beta_j \psi_j.
@f]
Plugging into the variational form yields the equation system
@f[
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{2.0}
\left.\begin{array}{ccc}
\sum_{j=1}^n
\left(
-\omega^2 \langle \phi_i, \phi_j \rangle_{\mathrm{L}^2(\Omega)}

\end{array}\right\}\;\;\forall\; i =1,\ldots,n.

\end{array}

@f]
(One should not be fooled by the right hand side being zero here, that is
because we haven't included the Dirichlet boundary data yet.)
Because of the alternating sign in the off-diagonal blocks, we can already
see that this system is non-symmetric, in fact it is even indefinite.
Of course, there is no necessity to choose the spaces $V_h$ and $W_h$ to be
the same. However, we expect real and imaginary part of the solution to
have similar properties and will therefore indeed take $V_h=W_h$ in the
implementation, and also use the same basis functions $\phi_i = \psi_i$ for
both spaces. The reason for the notation using different symbols is just that
it allows us to distinguish between shape functions for $v$ and $w$, as this
distinction plays an important role in the implementation.


<h3>The test case</h3>

For the computations, we will consider wave propagation in the unit square,
with ultrasound generated by a transducer lens that is shaped like a segment
of the circle with center at $(0.5, d)$ and a
radius slightly greater than $d$; this shape should lead to a focusing of the sound
wave at the center of the circle. Varying $d$ changes the "focus" of the lens
and affects the spatial distribution of the intensity of $u$, where our main
concern is how well $|u|=\sqrt{v^2+w^2}$ is focused.

In the program below, we will implement the complex-valued Helmholtz equations
using the formulation with split real and imaginary parts. We will also
discuss how to generate a domain that looks like a square with a slight bulge
simulating the transducer (in the
<code>UltrasoundProblem<dim>::make_grid()</code> function), and how to
generate graphical output that not only contains the solution components $v$ and
$w$, but also the magnitude $\sqrt{v^2+w^2}$ directly in the output file (in
<code>UltrasoundProblem<dim>::output_results()</code>). Finally, we use the
ParameterHandler class to easily read parameters like the focal distance $d$,
wave speed $c$, frequency $\omega$, and a number of other parameters from an
input file at run-time, rather than fixing those parameters in the source code
where we would have to re-compile every time we want to change parameters.

<h1>Results</h1>

The current program reads its run-time parameters from an input file
called <code>\step-29.prm</code> that looks like this:
@code
subsection Mesh & geometry parameters
  # Distance of the focal point of the lens to the x-axis
  set Focal distance        = 0.3

  # Number of global mesh refinement steps applied to initial coarse grid
  set Number of refinements = 5
end


subsection Physical constants
  # Wave speed
  set c     = 1.5e5

  # Frequency
  set omega = 3.0e7
end


subsection Output parameters
  # Name of the output file (without extension)
  set Output file   = solution

  # A name for the output format to be used
  set Output format = vtu
end
@endcode

As can be seen, we set
$d=0.3$, which amounts to a focus of the transducer lens
at $x=0.5$, $y=0.3$. The coarse mesh is refined 5 times,
resulting in 160x160 cells, and the output is written in vtu
format. The parameter reader understands many more parameters
pertaining in particular to the generation of output, but we
need none of these parameters here and therefore stick with
their default values.

Here's the console output of the program in debug mode:

@code

@endcode

(Of course, execution times will differ if you run the program
locally.) The fact that most of the time is spent on assembling
the system matrix and generating output is due to the many assertions
that need to be checked in debug mode. In release mode these parts
of the program run much faster whereas solving the linear system is
hardly sped up at all:

@code

The graphical output of the program looks as follows:


<table align="center" class="doxtable">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="https://www.dealii.org/images/steps/developer/step-29.v.png" alt="v = Re(u)">

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The first two pictures show the real and imaginary parts of
$u$, whereas the last shows the intensity $|u|$. One can clearly
see that the intensity is focused around the focal point of the
lens (0.5, 0.3), and that the focus
is rather sharp in $x$-direction but more blurred in $y$-direction, which is a
consequence of the geometry of the focusing lens, its finite aperture,
and the wave nature of the problem.

Because colorful graphics are always fun, and to stress the focusing
effects some more, here is another set of images highlighting how well
the intensity is actually focused in $x$-direction:

  </tr>
</table>


As a final note, the structure of the program makes it easy to
determine which parts of the program scale nicely as the mesh is
refined and which parts don't. Here are the run times for 5, 6, and 7
global refinements:

@endcode

Each time we refine the mesh once, so the number of cells and degrees
of freedom roughly quadruples from each step to the next. As can be seen,
generating the grid, setting up degrees of freedom, assembling the
linear system, and generating output scale pretty closely to linear,
whereas solving the linear system is an operation that requires 8
times more time each time the number of degrees of freedom is
increased by a factor of 4, i.e. it is ${\cal O}(N^{3/2})$. This can
be explained by the fact that (using optimal ordering) the
bandwidth of a finite element matrix is $B={\cal O}(N^{(dim-1)/dim})$,
and the effort to solve a banded linear system using LU decomposition
is ${\cal O}(BN)$. This also explains why the program does run in 3d
as well (after changing the dimension on the
<code>UltrasoundProblem</code> object), but scales very badly and
takes extraordinary patience before it finishes solving the linear
system on a mesh with appreciable resolution, even though all the
other parts of the program scale very nicely.



<a name="extensions"></a>
<h3>Possibilities for extensions</h3>

An obvious possible extension for this program is to run it in 3d
&mdash; after all, the world around us is three-dimensional, and
ultrasound beams propagate in three-dimensional media. You can try
this by simply changing the template parameter of the principal class
in <code>main()</code> and running it. This won't get you very far,
though: certainly not if you do 5 global refinement steps as set in
the parameter file. You'll simply run out of memory as both the mesh
(with its $(2^5)^3 \cdot 5^3=2^{15}\cdot 125 \approx 4\cdot 10^6$ cells)
and in particular the sparse direct solver take too much memory. You
can solve with 3 global refinement steps, however, if you have a bit
of time: in early 2011, the direct solve takes about half an
hour. What you'll notice, however, is that the solution is completely
wrong: the mesh size is simply not small enough to resolve the
solution's waves accurately, and you can see this in plots of the
solution. Consequently, this is one of the cases where adaptivity is
indispensable if you don't just want to throw a bigger (presumably
%parallel) machine at the problem.
