<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h3>Massively parallel non-matching grid simulations of fluid structure interaction problems</h3>

In this tutorial we consider a mixing problem in the laminar flow regime.
Such problems occur in a wide range of applications ranging from chemical engineering to power
generation (e.g. turbomachinery). Mixing problems are particularly hard to solve numerically,
because they often involve a container (with fixed boundaries, and possibly
complex geometries such as baffles), represented by the domain $\Omega$,
and one (or more) immersed and rotating impellers (represented by the domain $\Omega^{\text{imp}}$).
The domain in which we would like to solve the flow equations is the (time
dependent) difference between the two domains, namely:
$\Omega\setminus\Omega^{\text{imp}}$.

For rotating impellers, the use of Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian formulations
(in which the fluid domain -- along with the mesh! -- is smoothly deformed to follow the deformations
of the immersed solid) is not possible, unless only small times (i.e.,
small fluid domain deformations) are considered. If one wants to track the
evolution of the flow across multiple rotations of the impellers, the resulting
deformed grid would simply be too distorted to be useful.

In this case, a viable alternative strategy would be to use non-matching
methods (similarly to what we have done in step-60), where a background fixed
grid (that may or may not be locally refined in time to better capture the solid
motion) is coupled with a rotating, independent, grid.

In order to maintain the same notations used in step-60, we use $\Omega$ to
denote the domain in ${\mathbb R}^{\text{spacedim}}$ representing the container of both
the fluid and the impeller, and we use $\Gamma$ in ${\mathbb R}^{\text{dim}}$ to denote
either the full impeller (when its `spacedim` measure is non-negligible, i.e.,
when we can represent it as a grid of dimension `dim` equal to `spacedim`),
a co-dimension one representation of a thin impeller, or just the boundary of
the full impeller.

The domain $\Gamma$ is embedded in $\Omega$ ($\Gamma \subseteq \Omega$) and it
is non-matching: It does not, in general, align with any of the
features of the volume mesh. We solve a partial differential equation on $\Omega$,
enforcing some conditions on the solution of the problem on the embedded
domain $\Gamma$ by some penalization techniques. In the current case,
the condition is that the velocity of the fluid at points on $\Gamma$
equal the velocity of the solid impeller at that point.

The technique we describe here is presented in the literature using one of many
names: the <b>immersed finite element method</b> and the <b>fictitious boundary
method</b> among others.  The main principle is that the discretization of the
two grids are kept completely independent. In the present tutorial, this
approach is used to solve for the motion of a viscous fluid, described by the
Stokes equation, that is agitated by a rigid non-deformable impeller.

Thus, the equations solved in $\Omega$ are the Stokes equations for a creeping
flow (i.e. a flow where $\text{Re}\rightarrow 0$) and a no-slip boundary
condition is applied on the moving *embedded domain* $\Gamma$ associated with
the impeller. However, this tutorial could be readily extended
to other equations (e.g. the Navier-Stokes equations, linear elasticity
equation, etc.). It can be seen as a natural extension of step-60 that
enables the solution of large problems using a distributed parallel computing
architecture via MPI.

However, contrary to step-60, the Dirichlet boundary conditions on $\Gamma$
are imposed weakly instead of through the use of Lagrange multipliers, and we
concentrate on dealing with the coupling of two fully distributed
triangulations (a combination that was not possible in the implementation of
step-60).

There are two interesting scenarios that occur when one wants to enforce
conditions on the embedded domain $\Gamma$:

- The geometrical dimension `dim` of the embedded domain $\Gamma$ is the same of
the domain $\Omega$ (`spacedim`), that is, the spacedim-dimensional measure of
$\Gamma$ is not zero. In this case, the imposition of the Dirichlet boundary
boundary condition on $\Gamma$ is done through a volumetric penalization. If the
applied penalization only depends on the velocity, this is often referred
to as $\mathcal{L}^2$ penalization whereas if the penalization depends
on both the velocity and its gradient, it is an $\mathcal{H}^1$ penalization.
The case of the $\mathcal{L}^2$ penalization is very similar to a Darcy-type
approach. Both $\mathcal{L}^2$ and $\mathcal{H}^1$ penalizations have been
analyzed extensively (see, for example, @cite Angot1999).

- The embedded domain $\Gamma$ has an intrinsic dimension `dim` which is smaller
than that of $\Omega$ (`spacedim`), thus its spacedim-dimensional measure is
zero; for example it is a curve embedded in a two dimensional domain, or a
surface embedded in a three-dimensional domain. This is of course
physically impossible, but one may consider very thin sheets of metal
moving in a fluid as essentially lower-dimensional if the thickness of
the sheet is negligible. In this case, the boundary
condition is imposed weakly on $\Gamma$ by applying the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_Nitsche">Nitsche</a> method (see
@cite Freund1995).

Both approaches have very similar requirements and result in highly
similar formulations. Thus, we treat them almost in the same way.

In this tutorial program we are not interested in further details on $\Gamma$:
we assume that the dimension of the embedded domain (`dim`) is always smaller by
one or equal with respect to the dimension of the embedding domain $\Omega$
(`spacedim`).

We are going to solve the following differential problem: given a sufficiently
regular function $g$ on $\Gamma$, find the solution $(\textbf{u},p)$ to

@f{eqnarray*}
  -\Delta \mathbf{u} + \nabla p &=& 0,\\
  -\nabla \cdot \textbf{u} &=& 0,\\
  \textbf{u} &=& \textbf{g}  \text{ in } \Gamma,\\
  \textbf{u} &=& 0 \text{ on } \partial\Omega.
@f}

This equation, which we have normalized by scaling the time units in
such a way that the viscosity has a numerical value of 1, describes
slow, viscous flow such as honey or lava.
The main goal of this tutorial is to show how to impose the velocity field
condition $\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{g}$ on a non-matching $\Gamma$ in a weak way,
using a penalization method. A more extensive discussion of the Stokes
problem including body forces, different boundary conditions, and solution
strategies can be found in step-22.

Let us start by considering the Stokes problem alone, in the entire domain
$\Omega$. We look for a velocity field $\mathbf{u}$ and a pressure field $p$
that satisfy the Stokes equations with homogeneous boundary conditions
on $\partial\Omega$.

The weak form of the Stokes equations is obtained by first writing it in vector
form as
@f{eqnarray*}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    {-\Delta \textbf{u} + \nabla p}
    \\
    {-\textrm{div}\;\textbf{u}}
  \end{pmatrix}
  =
  \begin{pmatrix}
  0
  \\
  0
  \end{pmatrix},
@f}
forming the dot product from the left with a vector-valued test
function $\phi = \begin{pmatrix}\textbf{v} \\ q\end{pmatrix}$, and integrating
over the domain $\Omega$, yielding the following set of equations:
@f{eqnarray*}
  (\mathrm v,
   -\Delta \textbf{u} + \nabla p)_{\Omega}
  -
  (q,\textrm{div}\; \textbf{u})_{\Omega}
  =
  0
@f}
which has to hold for all test functions $\phi = \begin{pmatrix}\textbf{v}
\\ q\end{pmatrix}$.


Integrating by parts and exploiting the boundary conditions on $\partial\Omega$,
we obtain the following variational problem:
@f{eqnarray*}{
(\nabla \textbf{v}, \nabla \textbf{u})_{\Omega} - (\textrm{div}\; \textbf{v}, p)_{\Omega}
 - (q, \textrm{div}\; \textbf{u})_{\Omega}&=& 0
@f}

where $(\cdot, \cdot)_{\Omega}$ represents the $L^2$ scalar
product. This is the same variational form used in step-22.

This variational formulation does not take into account the embedded domain.
Contrary to step-60, we do not enforce strongly the constraints of
$\textbf{u}$ on $\Gamma$, but enforce them weakly via a penalization term.

The analysis of this weak imposition of the boundary condition depends on the
spacedim-dimensional measure of $\Gamma$ as either positive (if `dim` is equal
to `spacedim`) or zero (if `dim` is smaller than `spacedim`). We discuss both
scenarios.


<h4>Co-dimension one case</h4>

In this case, we assume that $\Gamma$ is the boundary of the actual impeller,
that is, a closed curve embedded in a two-dimensional domain or a closed
surface in a three-dimensional domain. The idea of this method starts by
considering a weak imposition of the Dirichlet boundary condition on $\Gamma$,
following the Nitsche method. This is achieved by using the following modified formulation
on the fluid domain, where no strong conditions on the test functions on $\Gamma$ are imposed:

@f{multline*}{
(\nabla \textbf{v}, \nabla \textbf{u})_{\Omega\setminus\Omega^{\text{imp}}} - (\textrm{div}\;  \textbf{v}, p)_{\Omega\setminus\Omega^{\text{imp}}}
  - (q, \textrm{div}\; \textbf{u})_{\Omega\setminus\Omega^{\text{imp}}} \\
  - (\textbf{v},\nabla \textbf{u} \cdot \textbf{n})_{\Gamma}
  + (\textbf{v}\cdot \textbf{n},p)_{\Gamma} \\
 -  (\nabla\textbf{v}\cdot \textbf{n},\textbf{u})_{\Gamma}
 + (q, \textbf{u} \cdot \textbf{n})_{\Gamma}
 + \beta (\textbf{v},\textbf{u})_{\Gamma} \\
=  - (\nabla\textbf{v}\cdot \textbf{n},\textbf{g})_{\Gamma} + (q, \textbf{g} \cdot \textbf{n})_{\Gamma}
 + \beta (\textbf{v},\textbf{g})_{\Gamma}.
@f}

The integrals over $\Gamma$ are lower-dimensional integrals. It can be shown (see
@cite Freund1995) that there exists a positive constant
$C_1$ so that if $\beta > C_1$, the weak imposition of the boundary will
be consistent and stable. The first two additional integrals on $\Gamma$ (the
second line in the equation above) appear naturally after integrating by parts,
when one does not assume that $\mathbf{v}$ is zero on
$\Gamma$.

The third line in the equation above contains two terms that are added to ensure
consistency of the weak form, and a stabilization term, that is there to enforce
the boundary condition with an error which is consistent with the approximation
error. The consistency terms and the stabilization term are added to the
right hand side with the actual boundary data $\mathbf{g}$.

When $\mathbf{u}$ satisfies the condition $\mathbf{u}=\mathbf{g}$ on $\Gamma$,
all the consistency and stability integrals on $\Gamma$ cancel out, and one is
left with the usual weak form of Stokes flow, that is, the above formulation is
consistent.

We note that an alternative (non-symmetric) formulation can be used :

@f{multline*}{
(\nabla \textbf{v}, \nabla \textbf{u})_{\Omega\setminus\Omega^{\text{imp}}} -  (\textrm{div}\;  \textbf{v}, p)_{\Omega\setminus\Omega^{\text{imp}}}
  - (q, \textrm{div}\; \textbf{u})_{\Omega\setminus\Omega^{\text{imp}}} \\
  -(\textbf{v},\nabla \textbf{u} \cdot \textbf{n})_{\Gamma}
  + (\textbf{v}\cdot \textbf{n},p)_{\Gamma} \\
   +(\nabla\textbf{v}\cdot \textbf{n},\textbf{u})_{\Gamma}
 - (q, \textbf{u} \cdot \textbf{n})_{\Gamma}
 + \beta (\textbf{v},\textbf{u})_{\Gamma} \\
=   (\nabla\textbf{v}\cdot \textbf{n},\textbf{g})_{\Gamma} - (q, \textbf{g} \cdot \textbf{n})_{\Gamma}
 + \beta (\textbf{v},\textbf{g})_{\Gamma}.
@f}
Note the different sign of the first terms on the third and fourth lines.
In this case, the stability and consistency conditions become $\beta > 0$. In
the symmetric case, the value of $\beta$ is dependent on $h$, and it is in
general chosen such that $\beta = C h^{-1} $ with $h$
a measure of size of the face being integrated and $C$ a constant such that
$1 \leq C \leq 10$. This is as one usually does with the Nitsche
penalty method to enforcing Dirichlet boundary conditions.

The non-symmetric approach, on the other hand, is related to how one
enforced continuity for the non-symmetric interior penalty method for
discontinuous Galerkin methods (the "NIPG" method @cite Riviere1999).
Even if the non-symmetric case seems advantageous w.r.t.
possible choices of stabilization parameters, we opt for the symmetric
discretization, since in this case it can be shown that the dual problem is
also consistent, leading to a solution where not only the energy norm of the
solution converges with the correct order, but also its $L^2$
norm. Furthermore, the resulting matrix remains symmetric.

The above formulation works under the assumption that the domain is discretized
exactly. However, if the deformation of the impeller is a rigid body
motion, it is possible to artificially extend the solution of the Stokes
problem inside the propeller itself, since a rigid body motion is also a
solution to the Stokes problem. The idea is then to solve the same problem,
inside $\Omega^{\text{imp}}$, imposing the same boundary conditions on
$\Gamma$, using the same penalization technique, and testing with test
functions $\mathbf{v}$ which are globally continuous over $\Omega$.

This results in the following (intermediate) formulation:
@f{multline*}{
(\nabla \textbf{v}, \nabla \textbf{u})_{\Omega} - (\textrm{div}\;  \textbf{v}, p)_{\Omega}
  - (q, \textrm{div}\; \textbf{u})_{\Omega} \\
  - (\textbf{v},  \lbrack \nabla \textbf{u} \rbrack \cdot \textbf{n})_{\Gamma}
  + (\textbf{v}\cdot \textbf{n},\lbrack p \rbrack )_{\Gamma} \\
 -  (\lbrack \nabla\textbf{v} \rbrack \cdot \textbf{n},\textbf{u})_{\Gamma}
 + (\lbrack q \rbrack, \textbf{u} \cdot n)_{\Gamma}
 + 2\beta (\textbf{v},\textbf{u})_{\Gamma} \\
=  - (\lbrack \nabla\textbf{v}\rbrack\cdot \textbf{n},\textbf{g})_{\Gamma} + (\lbrack q\rbrack, \textbf{g} \cdot n)_{\Gamma}
 + 2\beta (\textbf{v},\textbf{g})_{\Gamma},
@f}
where the jump terms, denoted with $\lbrack \cdot \rbrack$, are computed with
respect to a fixed orientation of the normal vector $\textbf{n}$. The
factor of 2 appears in front of $\beta$ since we see every part of
$\Gamma$ twice, once from within the fluid and once from within the
obstacle moving around in it. (For all of the other integrals over
$\Gamma$, we visit each part of $\Gamma$ twice, but with opposite
signs, and consequently get the jump terms.)

Here we notice that, unlike in discontinuous Galerkin methods, the test
and trial functions are continuous across $\Gamma$. Moreover, if $\Gamma$ is
not aligned with cell boundaries, all the jump terms are also zero, since, in
general, finite element function spaces are smooth inside each cell, and if
$\Gamma$ cuts through an element intersecting its boundary only at a finite
number of points, all the contributions on $\Gamma$, with the exception of
the stabilization ones, can be neglected from the formulation, resulting in
the following final form of the variational formulation:

@f{multline*}{
(\nabla \textbf{v}, \nabla \textbf{u})_{\Omega} - (\textrm{div}\;  \textbf{v}, p)_{\Omega}
  - (q, \textrm{div}\; \textbf{u})_{\Omega}  + 2\beta (\textbf{v},\textbf{u})_{\Gamma} \\
=  2\beta (\textbf{v},\textbf{g})_{\Gamma}.
@f}

In step-60, the imposition of the constraint
required the addition of new variables in the form of Lagrange multipliers.
This is not the case for this tutorial program. The imposition of the
boundary condition using Nitsche's method only modifies the system matrix
and the right-hand side without adding additional unknowns.
However, the velocity vector $\textbf{u}$ on the embedded domain will not match
exactly the prescribed velocity $\textbf{g}$, but only up to a numerical error
which is in the same order as the interpolation error of the finite element
method. Furthermore, as in step-60, we still need to integrate over the
non-matching embedded grid in order to construct the boundary term necessary
to impose the boundary condition over $\Gamma$.


<h4>Co-dimension zero case</h4>

In this case, $\Gamma$ has the same dimension, but is embedded into
$\Omega$. We can think of this as a thick object moving around in the fluid.
In the case of $\mathcal{L}^2$ penalization, the additional penalization
term can be interpreted as a Darcy term within $\Gamma$, resulting in:

@f{eqnarray*}
(\nabla \textbf{v}, \nabla \textbf{u})_{\Omega} - & (\textrm{div}\;  \textbf{v}, p)_{\Omega}
  - (q, \textrm{div}\; \textbf{u})_{\Omega}  + \beta (\textbf{v},\textbf{u})_{\Gamma}
=  \beta (\textbf{v},\textbf{g})_{\Gamma}.
@f}

Here, integrals over $\Gamma$ are simply integrals over a part of the volume.
The $\mathcal{L}^2$ penalization thus consists in adding a volumetric term that
constrains the velocity of the fluid to adhere to the velocity of the rigid body
within $\Gamma$. Also in this case, $\beta$ must be chosen sufficiently large
in order to ensure that the Dirichlet boundary condition in $\Gamma$ is
sufficiently respected, but not too high in order to maintain the proper
conditioning of the system matrix.

A $\mathcal{H}^1$ penalization may be constructed in a similar manner, with the
addition of a viscous component to the penalization that dampens the velocity
gradient within $\Gamma$:

@f{eqnarray*}{
(\nabla \textbf{v}, \nabla \textbf{u})_{\Omega} - & (\textrm{div}\;  \textbf{v}, p)_{\Omega}
  - (q, \textrm{div}\; \textbf{u})_{\Omega}
  + \beta_1 (\textbf{v},\textbf{u})_{\Gamma}
  + \beta_2 (\nabla \textbf{v}, \nabla \textbf{u})_{\Gamma}
=  \beta_1 (\textbf{v},\textbf{g})_{\Gamma}
+ \beta_2 (\nabla \textbf{v}, \nabla \textbf{g})_{\Gamma}.
@f}

Notice that the $L^2$ penalization (`dim` equal to `spacedim`) and the Nitsche
penalization (`dim` equal to `spacedim-1`) result in the exact same numerical
implementation, thanks to the dimension independent capabilities of deal.II.


<h4>Representation of Ω and Γ</h4>

In this tutorial, both the embedded grid $\Gamma$ and the embedding
grid are described using a parallel::distributed::Triangulation. These two
triangulations can be built from functions in the GridGenerator namespace or by reading
a mesh file produced with another application (e.g. GMSH, see the
discussion in step-49). This is slightly
more general than what was previously done in step-60.

The addition of the immersed boundary method, whether
it is in the `dim=spacedim` or `dim<spacedim` case, only introduces
additional terms in the system matrix and the right-hand side of the
system which result from the integration over $\Gamma$. This does not
modify the number of variables for which the problem
must be solved. The challenge is thus related to the integrals
that must be carried over $\Gamma$.

As usual in finite elements we split this integral into contributions from all
cells of the triangulation used to
discretize $\Gamma$, we transform the integral on $K$ to an integral on the
reference element $\hat K$, where $F_{K}$ is the mapping from $\hat K$ to $K$,
and compute the integral on $\hat K$ using a quadrature formula. For example:

\f[
\beta (\textbf{v},\textbf{u})_{\Gamma} =  \sum_{K\in \Gamma} \int_{\hat K}
\hat{\textbf{u}}(\hat x) (\textbf{v} \circ F_{K}) (\hat x) J_K (\hat x) \mathrm{d} \hat x =
\sum_{K\in \Gamma} \sum_{i=1}^{n_q}  \big(\hat{\textbf{u}}(\hat x_i)  (\textbf{v} \circ F_{K}) (\hat x_i) J_K (\hat x_i) w_i \big)
\f]

Computing this sum is non-trivial because we have to evaluate $(v_j \circ F_{K})
(\hat x_i)$. In general, if $\Gamma$ and $\Omega$ are not aligned, the point
$y_i = F_{K}(\hat x_i)$ is completely arbitrary with respect to $\Omega$, and unless
we figure out a way to interpolate all basis functions of $V_h(\Omega)$ on an
arbitrary point on $\Omega$, we cannot compute the integral needed.


To evaluate $(v_j \circ F_{K}) (\hat x_i)$ the following steps needs to be
taken (as shown in the picture below):

- For a given cell $K$ in $\Gamma$ compute the real point $y_i \dealcoloneq F_{K} (\hat
x_i)$, where $x_i$ is one of the quadrature points used for the integral on $K
\subseteq \Gamma$. This is the easy part:
FEValues::quadrature_point() gives us the real-space locations of all
quadrature points.

- Find the cell of $\Omega$ in which $y_i$ lies. We shall call this element $T$.

- Find the reference coordinates within $T$ of $y_i$. For this, we
need the inverse of the mapping $G_T$ that
transforms the reference element $\hat T$ into the element $T$: $\hat y_i = G^{-1}_{T} (y_i)$.

- Evaluate the basis function $v_j$ of the $\Omega$ mesh at this
  point $\hat y_i$. This is, again, relatively simple using FEValues.


<p align="center"> <img
  src="https://www.dealii.org/images/steps/developer/step-60.C_interpolation.png"
  alt=""> </p>

In step-60, the second through fourth steps above were computed by calling, in turn,

- GridTools::find_active_cell_around_point(), followed by

- Mapping::transform_real_to_unit_cell(). We then

- construct a custom Quadrature formula, containing the point in the reference
 cell and then

- construct an FEValues object, with the given quadrature formula, and
 initialized with the cell obtained in the first step.

Although this approach could work for the present case, it does not lends itself
readily to parallel simulations using distributed triangulations. Indeed,
since the position of the quadrature points on the cells of the
embedded domain $\Gamma$ do not match that of the embedding triangulation
and since $\Gamma$ is constantly moving, this would require that the triangulation representing
$\Gamma$ be stored in it's entirety for all of the processors. As the number
of processor and the number of cells in $\Gamma$ increases, this leads
to a severe bottleneck in terms of memory. Consequently, an alternative strategy is sought
in this step.


<h4>Using particles to track Γ</h4>

Remember that for both the penalization approach ($\mathcal{L}^2$ or $\mathcal{H}^1$)
and the Nitsche method, we want to compute integrals that are approximated by
the quadrature. That is, we need to compute
\f[
\beta (\textbf{v},\textbf{u})_{\Gamma} =
\sum_{K\in \Gamma} \sum_{i=1}^{n_q}  \big(\hat{\textbf{u}}(\hat x_i)  (\textbf{v} \circ F_{K}) (\hat x_i) J_K (\hat x_i) w_i \big)
\f]
If you followed the discussion above, then you will recall that $\textbf{u}$
and $\textbf{v}$ are shape functions defined on the fluid mesh.
The only things defined on the solid mesh are:
$F_K(\hat x_i)$, which is the location of a quadrature point on a solid cell that
is part of $\Gamma$, $J_K$ is the determinant of its Jacobian, and $w_i$ the corresponding
quadrature weight.

The important part to realize is now this: $w_i$ is a property of
the quadrature formula and does not change with time. Furthermore,
the Jacobian matrix of $F_K$ itself changes as the solid obstacle
moves around in the fluid, but because the solid is considered
non-deforming (it only translates and rotates, but doesn't dilate),
the determinant of the Jacobian remains constant. As a consequence,
the product $J_K(\hat x_i) w_i$ (which we typically denote by `JxW`)
remains constant for each quadrature point. So the only thing we need
keep track of are the positions $x_i=F_K(\hat x_i)$ -- but these
move with the velocity of the solid domain.

In other words, we don't actually need to keep the solid mesh at all.
All we need is the positions $x_i(t)$ and corresponding `JxW` values.
Since both of these properties are point-properties (or point-vectors) that are
attached to the solid material, they can be idealized as a set of disconnected
infinitesimally small "particles", which carry the required `JxW` information with the
movement of the solid. deal.II has the ability to distribute and
store such a set of particles in large-scale parallel computations in the form of
the ParticleHandler class (for details on the implementation see @cite GLHPW2018),
and we will make use of this functionality in this tutorial.

Thus, the approach taken in this step is as follows:
- Create a parallel::distributed::Triangulation for the domain $\Gamma$;
- Create Particles::Particle at the positions of the quadrature points on $\Gamma$;
- Call the Particles::ParticleHandler::insert_global_particles() function,
  to distribute the particles across processors, *following the solid
  triangulation*;
- Attach the `JxW` values as a "property" to each Particles::Particle object.

This structure is relatively expensive to generate, but must only be generated
once per simulation. Once the Particles::ParticleHandler is generated and the
required information is attached to the particle, the integrals over $\Gamma$
can be carried out by exploiting the fact that particles are grouped cellwise
inside ParticleHandler, allowing us to:
- Looping over all cells of $\Omega$ that contain at least one particle
- Looping over all particles in the given cell
- Compute the integrals and fill the global matrix.

Since the Particles::ParticleHandler can manage the exchange of particles from
one processor to the other, the embedded
triangulation can be moved or deformed by displacing the particles.
The only constraint associated with this displacement is that particles should
be displaced by a distance that is no larger than the size of one
cell. That's because that is the limit to which
Particles::ParticleHandler can track which cell a particle that leaves
its current cell now resides in.

Once the entire problem (the Stokes problem and the immersed boundary
imposition) is assembled,
the final saddle point problem is solved by an iterative solver, applied to the
Schur complement $S$ (whose construction is described, for example, in step-22),
and we construct $S$ using LinearOperator classes.


<h3>The testcase</h3>

The problem we solve here is a demonstration of the time-reversibility of Stokes
flow. This is often illustrated in science education experiments with a
Taylor-Couette flow and dye droplets that revert back to their original shape
after the fluid has been displaced in a periodic manner.

@endhtmlonly

In the present problem, a very viscous fluid is agitated by the rotation of
an impeller, which, in 2D, is modeled by a rectangular grid. The impeller
rotates for a given number of revolutions, after which the flow is reversed such
that the same number of revolutions is carried out in the opposite direction. We
recall that since the Stokes equations are self-adjoint, creeping flows are
reversible. Consequently, if the impeller motion is reversed in the opposite
direction, the fluid should return to its original position. In the present
case, this is illustrated by inserting a circle of passive tracer particles that
are advected by the fluid and which return to their original position, thus
demonstrating the time-reversibility of the flow.

<h1>Results</h1>

The directory in which this program is run contains a number of sample
parameter files that you can use to reproduce the results presented in this
section. If you do not specify a parameter file as an argument on the command
line, the program will try to read the file "`parameters.prm`" by default, and
will execute the two dimensional version of the code. As explained in
the discussion of the source code, if
your file name contains the string "23", then the program will run a three
dimensional problem, with immersed solid of co-dimension one. If it contains
the string "3", it will run a three dimensional problem, with immersed solid of
co-dimension zero, otherwise it will run a two dimensional problem with
immersed solid of co-dimension zero.

Regardless of the specific parameter file name, if the specified file does not
exist, when you execute the program you will get an exception that no such file
can be found:

@code

Additional information:
    You specified <parameters.prm> as input parameter file, but it does not exist. We created it for you.

However, as the error message already states, the code that triggers the
exception will also generate the specified file ("`parameters.prm`" in this case)
that simply contains the default values for all parameters this program cares
about (for the correct dimension and co-dimension, according to the whether a
string "23" or "3" is contained in the file name). By inspection of the default
parameter file, we see the following:

The rationale behind creating first `parameters.prm` file (the first time the
program is run) and then a `output/parameters_22.prm` (every time you
run the program with an existing input file), is because you may want
to leave most parameters to their
default values, and only modify a handful of them, while still beeing able to
reproduce the results and inspect what parameters were used for a specific
simulation. It is generally good scientific practice to store the
parameter file you used for a simulation along with the simulation
output so that you can repeat the exact same run at a later time if necessary.

Another reason is because the input file may only contain those
parameters that differ from their defaults.
For example, you could use the following (perfectly valid) parameter file with
this tutorial program:
@code
subsection Stokes Immersed Problem
  set Final time                         = 1
  set Nitsche penalty term               = 10
  set Number of time steps               = 101
  set Velocity degree                    = 3
end
@endcode
and you would run the program with Q3/Q2 Taylor-Hood finite elements, for 101
steps, using a Nitsche penalty of `10`, and leaving all the other parameters to
their default value. The output directory then contains a record of
not just these parameters, but indeed all parameters used in the
simulation. You can inspect all the other parameters in the
produced file `parameters_22.prm`.


<h3> Two dimensional test case </h3>

The default problem generates a co-dimension zero impeller, consisting of a
rotating rectangular grid, where the rotation is for half a time unit in one
direction, and half a time unit in the opposite direction, with constant angular
velocity equal to $\approx 2\pi \frac{\text{rad}}{\text{time unit}}$. Consequently, the impeller does half a
rotation and returns to its original position. The following animation
displays the velocity magnitude, the motion of the solid impeller and of the
tracer particles.

You may notice that assembling the coupling system is more expensive than
assembling the Stokes part. This depends highly on the number of Gauss points
(solid particles) that are used to apply the Nitsche restriction.
In the present case, a relatively low number of tracer particles are used.
Consequently, tracking their motion is relatively cheap.

The following movie shows the evolution of the solution over time:

 </p>

The movie shows the rotating obstacle in gray (actually a
superposition of the solid particles plotted with large enough dots
that they overlap), <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streamlines,_streaklines,_and_pathlines">streamlines
of the fluid flow</a> in light colors (including the corner vertices
that form at specific times during the simulation), and the tracer particles in
bluish tones.

The simulation shows that at the end time,
the tracer particles have somewhat returned to their
original position, although they have been distorted by the flow field. The
following image compares the initial and the final position of the particles
after one time unit of flow.

<p align="center">
   <div class="img" align="center">

</p>

In this case, we see that the tracer particles that were outside of the swept
volume of the impeller have returned very close to their initial position,
whereas those in the swept volume were slightly more deformed. This deformation
is non-physical. It is caused by the numerical error induced by the explicit
Euler scheme used to advect the particles, by the loss of accuracy due to the
fictitious domain and, finally, by the discretization error on the Stokes
equations. The first two errors are the leading cause of this deformation and
they could be alleviated by the use of a finer mesh and a lower time step.


<h3> Three dimensional test case </h3>

To play around a little bit, we complicate the fictitious domain (taken from
https://grabcad.com/library/lungstors-blower-1), and run a co-dimension one
simulation in three space dimensions, using the following
"`parameters_23.prm`" file:

    set Particle grid generator           = hyper_ball

  end
  subsection Refinement and remeshing
    set Maximum number of cells        = 100000
    set Refinement coarsening fraction = 0.3
    set Refinement fraction            = 0.3

    set Function expression = 0; 0; 0; 0
    set Variable names      = x,y,z,t

In this case, the timing outputs are a bit different:

@code

@endcode

Now, the solver is taking most of the solution time in three dimensions,
and the particle motion and Nitsche assembly remain relatively
unimportant as far as run time is concerned.

<h3>Possibilities for extensions</h3>

The current tutorial program shows a one-way coupling between the fluid and the
solid, where the solid motion is imposed (and not solved for), and read in the
solid domain by exploiting the location and the weights of the solid quadrature
points.

The structure of the code already allows one to implement a two-way coupling,
by exploiting the possibility to read values of the fluid velocity on the
quadrature points of the solid grid. For this to be more efficient in terms of
MPI communication patterns, one should maintain ownership of the quadrature
points on the solid processor that owns the cells where they have been created.
In the current code, it is sufficient to define the IndexSet of the vectors
used to exchange information of the quadrature points by using the solid
partition instead of the initial fluid partition.

This allows the combination of the technique used in this tutorial program with
those presented in the tutorial step-60 to solve a fluid structure interaction
problem with distributed Lagrange multipliers, on
parallel::distributed::Triangulation objects.

The timings above show that the current preconditioning strategy does not work
well for Nitsche penalization, and we should come up with a better
preconditioner if we want to aim at larger problems. Moreover, a checkpoint
restart strategy should be implemented to allow for longer simulations to be
interrupted and restored, as it is done for example in the step-69 tutorial.
