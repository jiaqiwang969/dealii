<h1>Introduction</h1>

The step-15 program solved the following, nonlinear equation
describing the minimal surface problem:
@f{align*}{
    -\nabla \cdot \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+|\nabla u|^{2}}}\nabla u \right) &= 0 \qquad
    \qquad &&\textrm{in} ~ \Omega
    \\
    u&=g \qquad\qquad &&\textrm{on} ~ \partial \Omega.
@f}
step-15 uses a Newton method, and
Newton's method works by repeatedly solving a *linearized* problem for
an update $\delta u_k$ -- called the "search direction" --, computing a
"step length"
$\alpha_k$, and then combining them to compute the new
guess for the solution via
@f{align*}{
    u_{k+1} = u_k + \alpha_k \, \delta u_k.
@f}

In the course of the discussions in step-15, we found that it is
awkward to compute the step length, and so just settled for simple
choice: Always choose $\alpha_k=0.1$. This is of course not efficient:
We know that we can only realize Newton's quadratic convergence rate
if we eventually are able to choose $\alpha_k=1$, though we may have
to choose it smaller for the first few iterations where we are still
too far away to use this long a step length.

Among the goals of this program is therefore to address this
shortcoming. Since line search algorithms are not entirely trivial to
implement, one does as one should do anyway: Import complicated
functionality from an external library. To this end, we will make use
of the interfaces deal.II has to one of the big nonlinear solver
packages, namely the
[KINSOL](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/kinsol)
sub-package of the
[SUNDIALS](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials)
suite. %SUNDIALS is, at its heart, a package meant to solve complex
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and differential-algebraic
equations (DAEs), and the deal.II interfaces allow for this via the
classes in the SUNDIALS namespace: Notably the SUNDIALS::ARKode and
SUNDIALS::IDA classes. But, because that is an important step in the
solution of ODEs and DAEs with implicit methods, %SUNDIALS also has a
solver for nonlinear problems called KINSOL, and deal.II has an
interface to it in the form of the SUNDIALS::KINSOL class. This is
what we will use for the solution of our problem.

But %SUNDIALS isn't just a convenient way for us to avoid writing a
line search algorithm. In general, the solution of nonlinear problems
is quite expensive, and one typically wants to save as much compute
time as possible. One way one can achieve this is as follows: The
algorithm in step-15 discretizes the problem and then in every
iteration solves a linear system of the form
@f{align*}{
  J_k \, \delta U_k = -F_k
@f}
where $F_k$ is the residual vector computed using the current vector
of nodal values $U_k$, $J_k$ is its derivative (called the
"Jacobian"), and $\delta U_k$ is the update vector that corresponds to
the function $\delta u_k$ mentioned above. The construction of
$J_k,F_k$ has been thoroughly discussed in step-15, as has the way to
solve the linear system in each Newton iteration. So let us focus on
another aspect of the nonlinear solution procedure: Computing $F_k$ is
expensive, and assembling the matrix $J_k$ even more so. Do we
actually need to do that in every iteration? It turns out that in many
applications, this is not actually necessary: These methods often converge
even if we replace $J_k$ by an approximation $\tilde J_k$ and solve
@f{align*}{
  \tilde J_k \, \widetilde{\delta U}_k = -F_k
@f}
instead, then update
@f{align*}{
    U_{k+1} = U_k + \alpha_k \, \widetilde{\delta U}_k.
@f}
This may require an iteration or two more because our update
$\widetilde{\delta U}_k$ is not quite as good as $\delta U_k$, but it
may still be a win because we don't have to assemble $J_k$ quite as
often.

What kind of approximation $\tilde J_k$ would we like for $J_k$? Theory
says that as $U_k$ converges to the exact solution $U^\ast$, we need to
ensure that $\tilde J_k$ needs to converge to $J^\ast = \nabla F(U^\ast)$.
In particular, since $J_k\rightarrow J^\ast$, a valid choice is
$\tilde J_k = J_k$. But so is choosing $\tilde J_k = J_k$ every, say,
fifth iteration $k=0,5,10,\ldots$ and for the other iterations, we choose
$\tilde J_k$ equal to the last computed $J_{k'}$. This is what we will do
here: we will just re-use $\tilde J_{k-1}$ from the
previous iteration, which may again be what we had used in the
iteration before that, $\tilde J_{k-2}$.

This scheme becomes even more interesting if, for the solution of the
linear system with $J_k$, we don't just have to assemble a matrix, but
also compute a good preconditioner. For example, if we were to use a
sparse LU decomposition via the SparseDirectUMFPACK class, or used a
geometric or algebraic multigrid. In those cases, we would also not
have to update the preconditioner, whose computation may have taken
about as long or longer than the assembly of the matrix in the first
place. Indeed, with this mindset, we should probably think about using
the *best* preconditioner we can think of, even though their
construction is typically quite expensive: We will hope to amortize
the cost of computing this preconditioner by applying it to more than
one just one linear solve.

The big question is, of course: By what criterion do we decide whether
we can get away with the approximation $\tilde J_k$ based on a
previously computed Jacobian matrix $J_{k-s}$ that goes back $s$
steps, or whether we need to -- at least in this iteration -- actually
re-compute the Jacobian $J_k$ and the corresponding preconditioner?
This is, like the issue with line search, one that requires a
non-trivial amount of code that monitors the convergence of the
overall algorithm. We *could* implement these sorts of things
ourselves, but we probably *shouldn't*: KINSOL already does that for
us. It will tell our code when to "update" the Jacobian matrix.

One last consideration if we were to use an iterative solver instead of
the sparse direct one mentioned above: Not only is it possible to get
away with replacing $J_k$ by some approximation $\tilde J_k$ when
solving for the update $\delta U_k$, but one can also ask whether it
is necessary to solve the linear system
@f{align*}{
  \tilde J_k \widetilde{\delta U}_k = -F_k
@f}
to high accuracy. The thinking goes like this: While our current solution
$U_k$ is still far away from $U^\ast$, why would we solve this linear
system particularly accurately? The update
$U_{k+1}=U_k + \widetilde{\delta U}_k$ is likely still going to be far away
from the exact solution, so why spend much time on solving the linear system
to great accuracy? This is the kind of thinking that underlies algorithms
such as the "Eisenstat-Walker trick" @cite eiwa96 in which one is given
a tolerance to which the linear system above in iteration $k$ has to be
solved, with this tolerance dependent on the progress in the overall
nonlinear solver. As before, one could try to implement this oneself,
but KINSOL already provides this kind of information for us -- though we
will not use it in this program since we use a direct solver that requires
no solver tolerance and just solves the linear system exactly up to
round-off.

As a summary of all of these considerations, we could say the
following: There is no need to reinvent the wheel. Just like deal.II
provides a vast amount of finite-element functionality, %SUNDIALS'
KINSOL package provides a vast amount of nonlinear solver
functionality, and we better use it.


<h3> How deal.II interfaces with KINSOL </h3>

KINSOL, like many similar packages, works in a pretty abstract way. At
its core, it sees a nonlinear problem of the form
@f{align*}{
    F(U) = 0
@f}
and constructs a sequence of iterates $U_k$ which, in general, are
vectors of the same length as the vector returned by the function
$F$. To do this, there are a few things it needs from the user:
- A way to resize a given vector to the correct size.
- A way to evaluate, for a given vector $U$, the function $F(U)$. This
  function is generally called the "residual" operation because the
  goal is of course to find a point $U^\ast$ for which $F(U^\ast)=0$;
  if $F(U)$ returns a nonzero vector, then this is the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_(numerical_analysis)">"residual"</a>
  (i.e., the "rest", or whatever is "left over"). The function
  that will do this is in essence the same as the computation of
  the right hand side vector in step-15, but with an important difference:
  There, the right hand side denoted the *negative* of the residual,
  so we have to switch a sign.
- A way to compute the matrix $J_k$ if that is necessary in the
  current iteration, along with possibly a preconditioner or other
  data structures (e.g., a sparse decomposition via
  SparseDirectUMFPACK if that's what we choose to use to solve a
  linear system). This operation will generally be called the
  "setup" operation.
- A way to solve a linear system $\tilde J_k x = b$ with whatever
  matrix $\tilde J_k$ was last computed. This operation will generally
  be called the "solve" operation.

All of these operations need to be provided to KINSOL by
[std::function](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/function)
objects that take the appropriate set of arguments and that generally
return an integer that indicates success (a zero return value) or
failure (a nonzero return value). Specifically, the objects we will
access are the
SUNDIALS::KINSOL::reinit_vector,
SUNDIALS::KINSOL::residual,
SUNDIALS::KINSOL::setup_jacobian, and
SUNDIALS::KINSOL::solve_jacobian_system
member variables. (See the documentation of these variables for their
details.) In our implementation, we will use
[lambda functions](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/lambda)
to implement these "callbacks" that in turn can call member functions;
KINSOL will then call these callbacks whenever its internal algorithms
think it is useful.


<h3> Details of the implementation </h3>

The majority of the code of this tutorial program is as in step-15,
and we will not comment on it in much detail. There is really just one
aspect one has to pay some attention to, namely how to compute $F(U)$
given a vector $U$ on the one hand, and $J(U)$ given a vector $U$
separately. At first, this seems trivial: We just take the
`assemble_system()` function and in the one case throw out all code
that deals with the matrix and in the other case with the right hand
side vector. There: Problem solved.

But it isn't quite as simple. That's because the two are not
independent if we have nonzero Dirichlet boundary values, as we do
here. The linear system we want to solve contains both interior and
boundary degrees of freedom, and when eliminating those degrees of
freedom from those that are truly "free", using for example
AffineConstraints::distribute_local_to_global(), we need to know the
matrix when assembling the right hand side vector.

Of course, this completely contravenes the original intent: To *not*
assemble the matrix if we can get away without it. We solve this
problem as follows:
- We set the starting guess for the solution vector, $U_0$, to one
  where boundary degrees of freedom already have their correct values.
- This implies that all updates can have zero updates for these
  degrees of freedom, and we can build both residual vectors $F(U_k)$
  and Jacobian matrices $J_k$ that corresponds to linear systems whose
  solutions are zero in these vector components. For this special
  case, the assembly of matrix and right hand side vectors is
  independent, and can be broken into separate functions.

There is an assumption here that whenever KINSOL asks for a linear
solver with the (approximation of the) Jacobian, that this will be for
for an update $\delta U$ (which has zero boundary values), a multiple
of which will be added to the solution (which already has the right
boundary values).  This may not be true and if so, we might have to
rethink our approach. That said, it turns out that in practice this is
exactly what KINSOL does when using a Newton method, and so our
approach is successful.

What is happening is this:
- In the first residual computation, KINSOL computes the residual to see whether
  the desired tolerance has been reached. The answer is no, so it requests the
  user program to compute the Jacobian matrix (and the function then also
  factorizes the matrix via SparseDirectUMFPACK).
- KINSOL then instructs us to solve a linear system of the form
  $J_k \, \delta U_k = -F_k$ with this matrix and the previously computed
  residual vector.
- It is then time to determine how far we want to go in this direction,
  i.e., do line search. To this end, KINSOL requires us to compute the
  residual vector $F(U_k + \alpha_k \delta U_k)$ for different step lengths
  $\alpha_k$. For the first step above, it finds an acceptable $\alpha_k$
  after two tries, the second time around it takes three tries.
- Having found a suitable updated solution $U_{k+1}$, the process is
  repeated except now KINSOL is happy with the current Jacobian matrix
  and does not instruct us to re-build the matrix and its factorization,
  and instead asks us to solve a linear system with that same matrix.

The program also writes the solution to a VTU file at the end
of each mesh refinement cycle, and it looks as follows:
<table width="60%" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="https://www.dealii.org/images/steps/developer/step-77.solution.png" alt="">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


The key takeaway messages of this program are the following:

- The solution is the same as the one we computed in step-15, i.e., the
  interfaces to %SUNDIALS' KINSOL package really did what they were supposed
  to do. This should not come as a surprise, but the important point is that
  we don't have to spend the time implementing the complex algorithms that
  underlie advanced nonlinear solvers ourselves.

- KINSOL is able to avoid all sorts of operations such as rebuilding the
  Jacobian matrix when that is not actually necessary. Comparing the
  number of linear solves in the output above with the number of times
  we rebuild the Jacobian and compute its factorization should make it
  clear that this leads to very substantial savings in terms of compute
  times, without us having to implement the intricacies of algorithms
  that determine when we need to rebuild this information.

<h3> Possibilities for extensions </h3>

For all but the small problems we consider here, a sparse direct solver
requires too much time and memory -- we need an iterative solver like
we use in many other programs. The trade-off between constructing an
expensive preconditioner (say, a geometric or algebraic multigrid method)
is different in the current case, however: Since we can re-use the same
matrix for numerous linear solves, we can do the same for the preconditioner
and putting more work into building a good preconditioner can more easily
be justified than if we used it only for a single linear solve as one
does for many other situations.

But iterative solvers also afford other opportunities. For example (and as
discussed briefly in the introduction), we may not need to solve to
very high accuracy (small tolerances) in early nonlinear iterations as long
as we are still far away from the actual solution. This was the basis of the
Eisenstat-Walker trick mentioned there.

KINSOL provides the function that does the linear solution with a target
tolerance that needs to be reached. We ignore it in the program above
because the direct solver we use does not need a tolerance and instead
solves the linear system exactly (up to round-off, of course), but iterative
solvers could make use of this kind of information -- and, in fact, should.
