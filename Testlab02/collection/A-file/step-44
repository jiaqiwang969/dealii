<h1>Introduction</h1>

The subject of this tutorial is nonlinear solid mechanics.
Classical single-field approaches (see e.g. step-18) can not correctly describe the response of quasi-incompressible materials.
The response is overly stiff; a phenomenon known as locking.
Locking problems can be circumvented using a variety of alternative strategies.
One such strategy is the  three-field formulation.
It is used here  to model the three-dimensional, fully-nonlinear (geometrical and material) response of an isotropic continuum body.
The material response is approximated as hyperelastic.
Additionally, the three-field formulation employed is valid for quasi-incompressible as well as compressible materials.

The objective of this presentation is to provide a basis for using deal.II for problems in nonlinear solid mechanics.
The linear problem was addressed in step-8.
A non-standard, hypoelastic-type form of the geometrically nonlinear problem was partially considered in step-18: a rate form of the linearised constitutive relations is used and the problem domain evolves with the motion.
Important concepts surrounding the nonlinear kinematics are absent in the theory and implementation.
Step-18 does, however, describe many of the key concepts to implement elasticity within the framework of deal.II.

We begin with a crash-course in nonlinear kinematics.
For the sake of simplicity, we restrict our attention to the quasi-static problem.
Thereafter, various key stress measures are introduced and the constitutive model described.
We then describe the three-field formulation in detail prior to explaining the structure of the class used to manage the material.
The setup of the example problem is then presented.

@note This tutorial has been developed (and is described in the introduction) for the problem of elasticity in three dimensions.
 While the space dimension could be changed in the main() routine, care needs to be taken.
 Two-dimensional elasticity problems, in general, exist only as idealizations of three-dimensional ones.
 That is, they are either plane strain or plane stress.
 The assumptions that follow either of these choices needs to be consistently imposed.
 For more information see the note in step-8.

The three-field formulation implemented here was pioneered by Simo et al. (1985) and is known as the mixed Jacobian-pressure formulation.
Important related contributions include those by Simo and Taylor (1991), and Miehe (1994).
The notation adopted here draws heavily on the excellent overview of the theoretical aspects of nonlinear solid mechanics by Holzapfel (2001).
A nice overview of issues pertaining to incompressible elasticity (at small strains) is given in Hughes (2000).

<h3> Notation </h3>

One can think of fourth-order tensors as linear operators mapping second-order
tensors (matrices) onto themselves in much the same way as matrices map
vectors onto vectors.
There are various fourth-order unit tensors that will be required in the forthcoming presentation.
The fourth-order unit tensors $\mathcal{I}$ and $\overline{\mathcal{I}}$ are defined by
@f[
	\mathbf{A} = \mathcal{I}:\mathbf{A}
		\qquad \text{and} \qquad
	\mathbf{A}^T = \overline{\mathcal{I}}:\mathbf{A} \, .
@f]
Note $\mathcal{I} \neq \overline{\mathcal{I}}^T$.
Furthermore, we define the symmetric and skew-symmetric fourth-order unit tensors by
@f[
	\mathcal{S} \dealcoloneq \dfrac{1}{2}[\mathcal{I} + \overline{\mathcal{I}}]
		\qquad \text{and} \qquad
	\mathcal{W} \dealcoloneq \dfrac{1}{2}[\mathcal{I} - \overline{\mathcal{I}}] \, ,
@f]
such that
@f[
	\dfrac{1}{2}[\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{A}^T] = \mathcal{S}:\mathbf{A}
		\qquad \text{and} \qquad
	\dfrac{1}{2}[\mathbf{A} - \mathbf{A}^T] = \mathcal{W}:\mathbf{A} \, .
@f]
The fourth-order <code>SymmetricTensor</code> returned by identity_tensor() is $\mathcal{S}$.


<h3>Kinematics</h3>

Let the time domain be denoted $\mathbb{T} = [0,T_{\textrm{end}}]$, where $t \in \mathbb{T}$ and $T_{\textrm{end}}$ is the total problem duration.
Consider a continuum body that occupies the reference configuration $\Omega_0$ at time $t=0$.
%Particles in the reference configuration are identified by the position vector $\mathbf{X}$.
The configuration of the body at a later time $t>0$ is termed the current configuration, denoted $\Omega$, with particles identified by the vector $\mathbf{x}$.
The nonlinear map between the reference and current configurations, denoted $\boldsymbol{\varphi}$, acts as follows:
@f[
	\mathbf{x} = \boldsymbol{\varphi}(\mathbf{X},t) \, .
@f]
The material description of the displacement of a particle is defined by
@f[
	\mathbf{U}(\mathbf{X},t) = \mathbf{x}(\mathbf{X},t) - \mathbf{X} \, .
@f]

The deformation gradient $\mathbf{F}$ is defined as the material gradient of the motion:
@f[
	\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{X},t)
		\dealcoloneq \dfrac{\partial \boldsymbol{\varphi}(\mathbf{X},t)}{\partial \mathbf{X}}
		= \textrm{Grad}\ \mathbf{x}(\mathbf{X},t)
		= \mathbf{I} + \textrm{Grad}\ \mathbf{U} \, .
@f]
The determinant of the of the deformation gradient
$J(\mathbf{X},t) \dealcoloneq \textrm{det}\ \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{X},t) > 0$
maps corresponding volume elements in the reference and current configurations, denoted
$\textrm{d}V$ and $\textrm{d}v$,
respectively, as
@f[
	\textrm{d}v = J(\mathbf{X},t)\; \textrm{d}V \, .
@f]

Two important measures of the deformation in terms of the spatial and material coordinates are the left and right Cauchy-Green tensors, respectively,
and denoted $\mathbf{b} \dealcoloneq \mathbf{F}\mathbf{F}^T$ and $\mathbf{C} \dealcoloneq \mathbf{F}^T\mathbf{F}$.
They are both symmetric and positive definite.

The Green-Lagrange strain tensor is defined by
@f[
	\mathbf{E} \dealcoloneq \frac{1}{2}[\mathbf{C} - \mathbf{I} ]
		= \underbrace{\frac{1}{2}[\textrm{Grad}^T \mathbf{U} +	\textrm{Grad}\mathbf{U}]}_{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}
			+ \frac{1}{2}[\textrm{Grad}^T\ \mathbf{U}][\textrm{Grad}\ \mathbf{U}] \, .
@f]
If the assumption of infinitesimal deformations is made, then the second term
on the right can be neglected, and $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$ (the linearised
strain tensor) is the only component of the strain tensor.
This assumption is, looking at the setup of the problem, not valid in step-18,
making the use of the linearized $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$ as the strain
measure in that tutorial program questionable.

In order to handle the different response that materials exhibit when subjected to bulk and shear type deformations we consider the following decomposition of the deformation gradient $\mathbf{F}$  and the left Cauchy-Green tensor $\mathbf{b}$ into volume-changing (volumetric) and volume-preserving (isochoric) parts:
@f[
	\mathbf{F}
		= (J^{1/3}\mathbf{I})\overline{\mathbf{F}}
	\qquad \text{and} \qquad
	\mathbf{b}
        = (J^{2/3}\mathbf{I})\overline{\mathbf{F}}\,\overline{\mathbf{F}}^T
		=  (J^{2/3}\mathbf{I})\overline{\mathbf{b}} \, .
@f]
Clearly, $\textrm{det}\ \mathbf{F} = \textrm{det}\ (J^{1/3}\mathbf{I}) = J$.

The spatial velocity field is denoted $\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t)$.
The derivative of the spatial velocity field with respect to the spatial coordinates gives the spatial velocity gradient $\mathbf{l}(\mathbf{x},t)$, that is
@f[
	\mathbf{l}(\mathbf{x},t)
		\dealcoloneq \dfrac{\partial \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t)}{\partial \mathbf{x}}
		= \textrm{grad}\ \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t) \, ,
@f]
where $\textrm{grad} \{\bullet \}
= \frac{\partial \{ \bullet \} }{ \partial \mathbf{x}}
= \frac{\partial \{ \bullet \} }{ \partial \mathbf{X}}\frac{\partial \mathbf{X} }{ \partial \mathbf{x}}
= \textrm{Grad} \{ \bullet \} \mathbf{F}^{-1}$.


<h3>Kinetics</h3>

Cauchy's stress theorem equates the Cauchy traction $\mathbf{t}$ acting on an infinitesimal surface element in the current configuration $\mathrm{d}a$ to the product of the Cauchy stress tensor $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ (a spatial quantity)  and the outward unit normal to the surface $\mathbf{n}$ as
@f[
	\mathbf{t}(\mathbf{x},t, \mathbf{n}) = \boldsymbol{\sigma}\mathbf{n} \, .
@f]
The Cauchy stress is symmetric.
Similarly,  the first Piola-Kirchhoff traction $\mathbf{T}$ which acts on an infinitesimal surface element in the reference configuration $\mathrm{d}A$ is the product of the first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor $\mathbf{P}$ (a two-point tensor)  and the outward unit normal to the surface $\mathbf{N}$ as
@f[
	\mathbf{T}(\mathbf{X},t, \mathbf{N}) = \mathbf{P}\mathbf{N} \, .
@f]
The Cauchy traction $\mathbf{t}$ and the first Piola-Kirchhoff traction $\mathbf{T}$ are related as
@f[
	\mathbf{t}\mathrm{d}a = \mathbf{T}\mathrm{d}A \, .
@f]
This can be demonstrated using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_strain_theory">Nanson's formula</a>.

The first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor is related to the Cauchy stress as
@f[
	\mathbf{P} = J \boldsymbol{\sigma}\mathbf{F}^{-T} \, .
@f]
Further important stress measures are the (spatial) Kirchhoff stress  $\boldsymbol{\tau} = J \boldsymbol{\sigma}$
and the (referential) second Piola-Kirchhoff stress
$\mathbf{S} = {\mathbf{F}}^{-1} \boldsymbol{\tau} {\mathbf{F}}^{-T}$.


<h3> Push-forward and pull-back operators </h3>

Push-forward and pull-back operators allow one to transform various measures between the material and spatial settings.
The stress measures used here are contravariant, while the strain measures are covariant.

The push-forward and-pull back operations for second-order covariant tensors $(\bullet)^{\text{cov}}$ are respectively given by:
@f[
	\chi_{*}(\bullet)^{\text{cov}} \dealcoloneq \mathbf{F}^{-T} (\bullet)^{\text{cov}} \mathbf{F}^{-1}
	\qquad \text{and} \qquad
	\chi^{-1}_{*}(\bullet)^{\text{cov}} \dealcoloneq \mathbf{F}^{T} (\bullet)^{\text{cov}} \mathbf{F} \, .
@f]

The push-forward and pull back operations for second-order contravariant tensors $(\bullet)^{\text{con}}$ are respectively given by:
@f[
	\chi_{*}(\bullet)^{\text{con}} \dealcoloneq \mathbf{F} (\bullet)^{\text{con}} \mathbf{F}^T
	\qquad \text{and} \qquad
	\chi^{-1}_{*}(\bullet)^{\text{con}} \dealcoloneq \mathbf{F}^{-1} (\bullet)^{\text{con}} \mathbf{F}^{-T} \, .
@f]
For example $\boldsymbol{\tau} = \chi_{*}(\mathbf{S})$.


<h3>Hyperelastic materials</h3>

A hyperelastic material response is governed by a Helmholtz free energy function $\Psi = \Psi(\mathbf{F}) = \Psi(\mathbf{C}) = \Psi(\mathbf{b})$ which serves as a potential for the stress.
For example, if the Helmholtz free energy depends on the right Cauchy-Green tensor $\mathbf{C}$ then the isotropic hyperelastic response is
@f[
	\mathbf{S}
		= 2 \dfrac{\partial \Psi(\mathbf{C})}{\partial \mathbf{C}} \, .
@f]
If the Helmholtz free energy depends on the left Cauchy-Green tensor $\mathbf{b}$ then the isotropic hyperelastic response is
@f[
	\boldsymbol{\tau}
		= 2 \dfrac{\partial \Psi(\mathbf{b})}{\partial \mathbf{b}} \mathbf{b}
		=  2 \mathbf{b} \dfrac{\partial \Psi(\mathbf{b})}{\partial \mathbf{b}} \, .
@f]

Following the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient, the Helmholtz free energy can be decomposed as
@f[
	\Psi(\mathbf{b}) = \Psi_{\text{vol}}(J) + \Psi_{\text{iso}}(\overline{\mathbf{b}}) \, .
@f]
Similarly, the Kirchhoff stress can be decomposed into volumetric and isochoric parts as $\boldsymbol{\tau} = \boldsymbol{\tau}_{\text{vol}} + \boldsymbol{\tau}_{\text{iso}}$ where:
@f{align*}
	\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\text{vol}} &=
		2 \mathbf{b} \dfrac{\partial \Psi_{\textrm{vol}}(J)}{\partial \mathbf{b}}
		\\
		&= p J\mathbf{I} \, ,
		\\
	\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\text{iso}} &=
		2 \mathbf{b} \dfrac{\partial \Psi_{\textrm{iso}} (\overline{\mathbf{b}})}{\partial \mathbf{b}}
		\\
		&= \underbrace{( \mathcal{I} - \dfrac{1}{3} \mathbf{I} \otimes \mathbf{I})}_{\mathbb{P}} : \overline{\boldsymbol{\tau}} \, ,
@f}
where
$p \dealcoloneq \dfrac{\partial \Psi_{\text{vol}}(J)}{\partial J}$ is the pressure response.
$\mathbb{P}$ is the projection tensor which provides the deviatoric operator in the Eulerian setting.
The fictitious Kirchhoff stress tensor $\overline{\boldsymbol{\tau}}$ is defined by
@f[
	\overline{\boldsymbol{\tau}}
		\dealcoloneq 2 \overline{\mathbf{b}} \dfrac{\partial \Psi_{\textrm{iso}}(\overline{\mathbf{b}})}{\partial \overline{\mathbf{b}}} \, .
@f]


@note The pressure response as defined above differs from the widely-used definition of the
pressure in solid mechanics as
$p = - 1/3 \textrm{tr} \boldsymbol{\sigma} = - 1/3 J^{-1} \textrm{tr} \boldsymbol{\tau}$.
Here $p$ is the hydrostatic pressure.
We make use of the pressure response throughout this tutorial (although we refer to it as the pressure).

<h4> Neo-Hookean materials </h4>

The Helmholtz free energy corresponding to a compressible <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Hookean_solid">neo-Hookean material</a> is given by
@f[
    \Psi \equiv
        \underbrace{\kappa [ \mathcal{G}(J) ] }_{\Psi_{\textrm{vol}}(J)}
        + \underbrace{\bigl[c_1 [ \overline{I}_1 - 3] \bigr]}_{\Psi_{\text{iso}}(\overline{\mathbf{b}})} \, ,
@f]
where $\kappa \dealcoloneq \lambda + 2/3 \mu$ is the bulk modulus ($\lambda$ and $\mu$ are the Lam&eacute; parameters)
and $\overline{I}_1 \dealcoloneq \textrm{tr}\ \overline{\mathbf{b}}$.
The function $\mathcal{G}(J)$ is required to be strictly convex and satisfy the condition $\mathcal{G}(1) = 0$,
among others, see Holzapfel (2001) for further details.
In this work $\mathcal{G} \dealcoloneq \frac{1}{4} [ J^2 - 1 - 2\textrm{ln}J ]$.

Incompressibility imposes the isochoric constraint that $J=1$ for all motions $\boldsymbol{\varphi}$.
The Helmholtz free energy corresponding to an incompressible neo-Hookean material is given by
@f[
    \Psi \equiv
        \underbrace{\bigl[ c_1 [ I_1 - 3] \bigr] }_{\Psi_{\textrm{iso}}(\mathbf{b})} \, ,
@f]
where $ I_1 \dealcoloneq \textrm{tr}\mathbf{b} $.
Thus, the incompressible response is obtained by removing the volumetric component from the compressible free energy and enforcing $J=1$.


<h3>Elasticity tensors</h3>

We will use a Newton-Raphson strategy to solve the nonlinear boundary value problem.
Thus, we will need to linearise the constitutive relations.

The fourth-order elasticity tensor in the material description is defined by
@f[
	\mathfrak{C}
		= 2\dfrac{\partial \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{C})}{\partial \mathbf{C}}
		= 4\dfrac{\partial^2 \Psi(\mathbf{C})}{\partial \mathbf{C} \partial \mathbf{C}} \, .
@f]
The fourth-order elasticity tensor in the spatial description $\mathfrak{c}$ is obtained from the push-forward of $\mathfrak{C}$ as
@f[
	\mathfrak{c} = J^{-1} \chi_{*}(\mathfrak{C})
		\qquad \text{and thus} \qquad
	J\mathfrak{c} = 4 \mathbf{b} \dfrac{\partial^2 \Psi(\mathbf{b})} {\partial \mathbf{b} \partial \mathbf{b}} \mathbf{b}	\, .
@f]
The fourth-order elasticity tensors (for hyperelastic materials) possess both major and minor symmetries.

The fourth-order spatial elasticity tensor can be written in the following decoupled form:
@f[
	\mathfrak{c} = \mathfrak{c}_{\text{vol}} + \mathfrak{c}_{\text{iso}} \, ,
@f]
where
@f{align*}
	J \mathfrak{c}_{\text{vol}}
		&= 4 \mathbf{b} \dfrac{\partial^2 \Psi_{\text{vol}}(J)} {\partial \mathbf{b} \partial \mathbf{b}} \mathbf{b}
		\\
		&= J[\widehat{p}\, \mathbf{I} \otimes \mathbf{I} - 2p \mathcal{I}]
			\qquad \text{where} \qquad
		\widehat{p} \dealcoloneq p + \dfrac{\textrm{d} p}{\textrm{d}J} \, ,
		\\
	J \mathfrak{c}_{\text{iso}}
		&=  4 \mathbf{b} \dfrac{\partial^2 \Psi_{\text{iso}}(\overline{\mathbf{b}})} {\partial \mathbf{b} \partial \mathbf{b}} \mathbf{b}
		\\
		&= \mathbb{P} : \mathfrak{\overline{c}} : \mathbb{P}
			+ \dfrac{2}{3}[\overline{\boldsymbol{\tau}}:\mathbf{I}]\mathbb{P}
			- \dfrac{2}{3}[ \mathbf{I}\otimes\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\text{iso}}
				+ \boldsymbol{\tau}_{\text{iso}} \otimes \mathbf{I} ] \, ,
@f}
where the fictitious elasticity tensor $\overline{\mathfrak{c}}$ in the spatial description is defined by
@f[
	\overline{\mathfrak{c}}
		= 4 \overline{\mathbf{b}} \dfrac{ \partial^2 \Psi_{\textrm{iso}}(\overline{\mathbf{b}})} {\partial \overline{\mathbf{b}} \partial \overline{\mathbf{b}}} \overline{\mathbf{b}} \, .
@f]

<h3>Principle of stationary potential energy and the three-field formulation</h3>

The total potential energy of the system $\Pi$ is the sum of the internal and external potential energies, denoted $\Pi_{\textrm{int}}$ and $\Pi_{\textrm{ext}}$, respectively.
We wish to find the equilibrium configuration by minimising the potential energy.

As mentioned above, we adopt a three-field formulation.
We denote the set of primary unknowns by
$\mathbf{\Xi} \dealcoloneq \{ \mathbf{u}, \widetilde{p}, \widetilde{J} \}$.
The independent kinematic variable $\widetilde{J}$ enters the formulation as a constraint on $J$ enforced by the Lagrange multiplier $\widetilde{p}$ (the pressure, as we shall see).

The three-field variational principle used here is given by
@f[
	\Pi(\mathbf{\Xi}) \dealcoloneq \int_\Omega \bigl[
		\Psi_{\textrm{vol}}(\widetilde{J})
		+ \widetilde{p}\,[J(\mathbf{u}) - \widetilde{J}]
		+ \Psi_{\textrm{iso}}(\overline{\mathbf{b}}(\mathbf{u}))
		\bigr] \textrm{d}v
	+ 	\Pi_{\textrm{ext}} \, ,
@f]
where the external potential is defined by
@f[
	\Pi_{\textrm{ext}}
		= - \int_\Omega \mathbf{b}^\text{p} \cdot \mathbf{u}~\textrm{d}v
			- \int_{\partial \Omega_{\sigma}} \mathbf{t}^\text{p} \cdot \mathbf{u}~\textrm{d}a \, .
@f]
The boundary of the current configuration  $\partial \Omega$ is composed into two parts as
$\partial \Omega = \partial \Omega_{\mathbf{u}} \cup \partial \Omega_{\sigma}$,
where
$\partial \Omega_{\mathbf{u}} \cap \partial \Omega_{\boldsymbol{\sigma}} = \emptyset$.
The prescribed Cauchy traction, denoted $\mathbf{t}^\text{p}$, is applied to $ \partial \Omega_{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ while the motion is prescribed on the remaining portion of the boundary $\partial \Omega_{\mathbf{u}}$.
The body force per unit current volume is denoted $\mathbf{b}^\text{p}$.



The stationarity of the potential follows as
@f{align*}
	R(\mathbf\Xi;\delta \mathbf{\Xi})
		&= D_{\delta \mathbf{\Xi}}\Pi(\mathbf{\Xi})
		\\
		&= \dfrac{\partial \Pi(\mathbf{\Xi})}{\partial \mathbf{u}} \cdot \delta \mathbf{u}
			+ \dfrac{\partial \Pi(\mathbf{\Xi})}{\partial \widetilde{p}} \delta \widetilde{p}
			+ \dfrac{\partial \Pi(\mathbf{\Xi})}{\partial \widetilde{J}} \delta \tilde{J}
			\\
		&= \int_{\Omega_0}  \left[
			\textrm{grad}\ \delta\mathbf{u} : [ \underbrace{[\widetilde{p} J \mathbf{I}]}_{\equiv \boldsymbol{\tau}_{\textrm{vol}}}
            +  \boldsymbol{\tau}_{\textrm{iso}}]
			+ \delta \widetilde{p}\, [ J(\mathbf{u}) - \widetilde{J}]
			+ \delta \widetilde{J}\left[ \dfrac{\textrm{d} \Psi_{\textrm{vol}}(\widetilde{J})}{\textrm{d} \widetilde{J}}
            -\widetilde{p}\right]
			\right]~\textrm{d}V
			\\
		&\quad - \int_{\Omega_0} \delta \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{B}^\text{p}~\textrm{d}V
			- \int_{\partial \Omega_{0,\boldsymbol{\sigma}}} \delta \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{T}^\text{p}~\textrm{d}A
			\\
		&=0 \, ,
@f}
for all virtual displacements $\delta \mathbf{u} \in H^1(\Omega)$ subject to the constraint that $\delta \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{0}$ on $\partial \Omega_{\mathbf{u}}$, and all virtual pressures $\delta \widetilde{p} \in L^2(\Omega)$ and virtual dilatations $\delta \widetilde{J} \in L^2(\Omega)$.

One should note that the definitions of the volumetric Kirchhoff stress in the three field formulation
$\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\textrm{vol}} \equiv \widetilde{p} J \mathbf{I}$
 and the subsequent volumetric tangent differs slightly from the general form given in the section on hyperelastic materials where
$\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\textrm{vol}} \equiv p J\mathbf{I}$.
This is because the pressure $\widetilde{p}$ is now a primary field as opposed to a constitutively derived quantity.
One needs to carefully distinguish between the primary fields and those obtained from the constitutive relations.

@note Although the variables are all expressed in terms of spatial quantities, the domain of integration is the initial configuration.
This approach is called a <em> total-Lagrangian formulation </em>.
The approach given in step-18, where the domain of integration is the current configuration, could be called an <em> updated Lagrangian formulation </em>.
The various merits of these two approaches are discussed widely in the literature.
It should be noted however that they are equivalent.


The Euler-Lagrange equations corresponding to the residual are:
@f{align*}
	&\textrm{div}\ \boldsymbol{\sigma} + \mathbf{b}^\text{p} = \mathbf{0} && \textrm{[equilibrium]}
		\\
	&J(\mathbf{u}) = \widetilde{J} 		&& \textrm{[dilatation]}
		\\
	&\widetilde{p} = \dfrac{\textrm{d} \Psi_{\textrm{vol}}(\widetilde{J})}{\textrm{d} \widetilde{J}} && \textrm{[pressure]} \, .
@f}
The first equation is the (quasi-static) equilibrium equation in the spatial setting.
The second is the constraint that $J(\mathbf{u}) = \widetilde{J}$.
The third is the definition of the pressure $\widetilde{p}$.

@note The simplified single-field derivation ($\mathbf{u}$ is the only primary variable) below makes it clear how we transform the limits of integration to the reference domain:
@f{align*}
\int_{\Omega}\delta \mathbf{u} \cdot [\textrm{div}\ \boldsymbol{\sigma} + \mathbf{b}^\text{p}]~\mathrm{d}v
&=
\int_{\Omega} [-\mathrm{grad}\delta \mathbf{u}:\boldsymbol{\sigma} + \delta \mathbf{u} \cdot\mathbf{b}^\text{p}]~\mathrm{d}v
  + \int_{\partial \Omega} \delta \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{t}^\text{p}~\mathrm{d}a \\
&=
- \int_{\Omega_0} \mathrm{grad}\delta \mathbf{u}:\boldsymbol{\tau}~\mathrm{d}V
+ \int_{\Omega_0} \delta \mathbf{u} \cdot J\mathbf{b}^\text{p}~\mathrm{d}V
 + \int_{\partial \Omega_0} \delta \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{T}^\text{p}~\mathrm{d}A \\
&=
- \int_{\Omega_0} \mathrm{grad}\delta \mathbf{u}:\boldsymbol{\tau}~\mathrm{d}V
+ \int_{\Omega_0} \delta \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{B}^\text{p}~\mathrm{d}V
 + \int_{\partial \Omega_{0,\sigma}} \delta \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{T}^\text{p}~\mathrm{d}A \\
&=
- \int_{\Omega_0} [\mathrm{grad}\delta\mathbf{u}]^{\text{sym}} :\boldsymbol{\tau}~\mathrm{d}V
+ \int_{\Omega_0} \delta \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{B}^\text{p}~\mathrm{d}V
 + \int_{\partial \Omega_{0,\sigma}} \delta \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{T}^\text{p}~\mathrm{d}A \, ,
@f}
where
$[\mathrm{grad}\delta\mathbf{u}]^{\text{sym}} = 1/2[ \mathrm{grad}\delta\mathbf{u} + [\mathrm{grad}\delta\mathbf{u}]^T] $.

We will use an iterative Newton-Raphson method to solve the nonlinear residual equation $R$.
For the sake of simplicity we assume dead loading, i.e. the loading does not change due to the deformation.

The change in a quantity between the known state at $t_{\textrm{n}-1}$
and the currently unknown state at $t_{\textrm{n}}$ is denoted
$\varDelta \{ \bullet \} = { \{ \bullet \} }^{\textrm{n}} - { \{ \bullet \} }^{\textrm{n-1}}$.
The value of a quantity at the current iteration $\textrm{i}$ is denoted
${ \{ \bullet \} }^{\textrm{n}}_{\textrm{i}} = { \{ \bullet \} }_{\textrm{i}}$.
The incremental change between iterations $\textrm{i}$ and $\textrm{i}+1$ is denoted
$d \{ \bullet \} \dealcoloneq \{ \bullet \}_{\textrm{i}+1} - \{ \bullet \}_{\textrm{i}}$.

Assume that the state of the system is known for some iteration $\textrm{i}$.
The linearised approximation to nonlinear governing equations to be solved using the  Newton-Raphson method is:
Find $d \mathbf{\Xi}$ such that
@f[
	R(\mathbf{\Xi}_{\mathsf{i}+1}) =
		R(\mathbf{\Xi}_{\mathsf{i}})
		+ D^2_{d \mathbf{\Xi}, \delta \mathbf{\Xi}} \Pi(\mathbf{\Xi_{\mathsf{i}}}) \cdot d \mathbf{\Xi} \equiv 0 \, ,
@f]
then set
$\mathbf{\Xi}_{\textrm{i}+1} = \mathbf{\Xi}_{\textrm{i}}
+ d \mathbf{\Xi}$.
The tangent is given by

@f[
	D^2_{d \mathbf{\Xi}, \delta \mathbf{\Xi}} \Pi( \mathbf{\Xi}_{\mathsf{i}} )
		= D_{d \mathbf{\Xi}} R( \mathbf{\Xi}_{\mathsf{i}}; \delta \mathbf{\Xi})
		=: K(\mathbf{\Xi}_{\mathsf{i}}; d \mathbf{\Xi}, \delta \mathbf{\Xi}) \, .

Thus,
@f{align*}
 	K(\mathbf{\Xi}_{\mathsf{i}}; d \mathbf{\Xi}, \delta \mathbf{\Xi})

<h3> Discretization of governing equations </h3>

The three-field formulation used here is effective for quasi-incompressible materials,
that is where $\nu \rightarrow 0.5$ (where $\nu$ is <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson's_ratio">Poisson's ratio</a>), subject to a good choice of the interpolation fields
for $\mathbf{u},~\widetilde{p}$ and $\widetilde{J}$.
Typically a choice of $Q_n \times DGPM_{n-1} \times DGPM_{n-1}$ is made.
Here $DGPM$ is the FE_DGPMonomial class.
A popular choice is $Q_1 \times DGPM_0 \times DGPM_0$ which is known as the mean dilatation method (see Hughes (2000) for an intuitive discussion).
This code can accommodate a $Q_n \times DGPM_{n-1} \times DGPM_{n-1}$ formulation.
The discontinuous approximation
allows $\widetilde{p}$ and $\widetilde{J}$ to be condensed out
and a classical displacement based method is recovered.

For fully-incompressible materials $\nu = 0.5$ and the three-field formulation will still exhibit
locking behavior.
This can be overcome by introducing an additional constraint into the free energy of the form
$\int_{\Omega_0} \Lambda [ \widetilde{J} - 1]~\textrm{d}V$.
Here $\Lambda$ is a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the isochoric constraint.
For further details see Miehe (1994).

The linearised problem can be written as
@f[
	\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}( \mathbf{\Xi}_{\textrm{i}}) d\mathbf{\Xi}
	=
	\mathbf{ \mathsf{F}}(\mathbf{\Xi}_{\textrm{i}})
@f]
where
@f{align*}
		\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
			\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{uu}	&	\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{u\widetilde{p}}	& \mathbf{0}
			\\
			\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{\widetilde{p}u}	&	\mathbf{0}	&	\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{\widetilde{p}\widetilde{J}}
			\\
			\mathbf{0}	& 	\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{\widetilde{J}\widetilde{p}}		& \mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{\widetilde{J}\widetilde{J}}
		\end{bmatrix}}_{\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}(\mathbf{\Xi}_{\textrm{i}})}
		\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
			d \mathbf{\mathsf{u}}\\
            d \widetilde{\mathbf{\mathsf{p}}} \\
            d \widetilde{\mathbf{\mathsf{J}}}
		\end{bmatrix}}_{d \mathbf{\Xi}}
        =
        \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
			-\mathbf{\mathsf{R}}_{u}(\mathbf{u}_{\textrm{i}}) \\
            -\mathbf{\mathsf{R}}_{\widetilde{p}}(\widetilde{p}_{\textrm{i}}) \\
           -\mathbf{\mathsf{R}}_{\widetilde{J}}(\widetilde{J}_{\textrm{i}})
		\end{bmatrix}}_{ -\mathbf{\mathsf{R}}(\mathbf{\Xi}_{\textrm{i}}) }
=
        \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
			\mathbf{\mathsf{F}}_{u}(\mathbf{u}_{\textrm{i}}) \\
            \mathbf{\mathsf{F}}_{\widetilde{p}}(\widetilde{p}_{\textrm{i}}) \\
           \mathbf{\mathsf{F}}_{\widetilde{J}}(\widetilde{J}_{\textrm{i}})
		\end{bmatrix}}_{ \mathbf{\mathsf{F}}(\mathbf{\Xi}_{\textrm{i}}) } \, .
@f}

There are no derivatives of the pressure and dilatation (primary) variables present in the formulation.
Thus the discontinuous finite element interpolation of the pressure and dilatation yields a block
diagonal matrix for
$\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{\widetilde{p}\widetilde{J}}$,
$\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{\widetilde{J}\widetilde{p}}$ and
$\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{\widetilde{J}\widetilde{J}}$.
Therefore we can easily express the fields $\widetilde{p}$ and $\widetilde{J}$ on each cell simply
by inverting a local matrix and multiplying it by the local right hand
side. We can then insert the result into the remaining equations and recover
a classical displacement-based method.
In order to condense out the pressure and dilatation contributions at the element level we need the following results:
@f{align*}
		d \widetilde{\mathbf{\mathsf{p}}}
		& = \mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{\widetilde{J}\widetilde{p}}^{-1} \bigl[
			 \mathbf{\mathsf{F}}_{\widetilde{J}}
			 - \mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{\widetilde{J}\widetilde{J}} d \widetilde{\mathbf{\mathsf{J}}} \bigr]
			\\
		d \widetilde{\mathbf{\mathsf{J}}}
		& = \mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{\widetilde{p}\widetilde{J}}^{-1} \bigl[
			\mathbf{\mathsf{F}}_{\widetilde{p}}
			- \mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{\widetilde{p}u} d \mathbf{\mathsf{u}}
			\bigr]
		\\
		 \Rightarrow d \widetilde{\mathbf{\mathsf{p}}}
		&=  \mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{\widetilde{J}\widetilde{p}}^{-1} \mathbf{\mathsf{F}}_{\widetilde{J}}
		- \underbrace{\bigl[\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{\widetilde{J}\widetilde{p}}^{-1} \mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{\widetilde{J}\widetilde{J}}
		\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{\widetilde{p}\widetilde{J}}^{-1}\bigr]}_{\overline{\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}}}\bigl[ \mathbf{\mathsf{F}}_{\widetilde{p}}
 		- \mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{\widetilde{p}u} d \mathbf{\mathsf{u}} \bigr]
@f}
and thus
@f[
		\underbrace{\bigl[ \mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{uu} + \overline{\overline{\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}}}~ \bigr]
		}_{\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{\textrm{con}}} d \mathbf{\mathsf{u}}
		=
        \underbrace{
		\Bigl[
		\mathbf{\mathsf{F}}_{u}
			- \mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{u\widetilde{p}} \bigl[ \mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{\widetilde{J}\widetilde{p}}^{-1} \mathbf{\mathsf{F}}_{\widetilde{J}}
			- \overline{\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}}\mathbf{\mathsf{F}}_{\widetilde{p}} \bigr]
		\Bigr]}_{\mathbf{\mathsf{F}}_{\textrm{con}}}
@f]
where
@f[
		\overline{\overline{\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}}} \dealcoloneq
			\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{u\widetilde{p}} \overline{\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}} \mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{\widetilde{p}u} \, .
@f]
Note that due to the choice of $\widetilde{p}$ and $\widetilde{J}$ as discontinuous at the element level, all matrices that need to be inverted are defined at the element level.

The procedure to construct the various contributions is as follows:
- Construct $\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}$.
- Form $\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{\widetilde{p}\widetilde{J}}^{-1}$ for element and store where $\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{\widetilde{p}\widetilde{J}}$ was stored in $\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}$.
- Form $\overline{\overline{\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}}}$ and add to $\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{uu}$ to get $\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{\textrm{con}}$
- The modified system matrix is called ${\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}}_{\textrm{store}}$.
  That is
  @f[
        \mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{\textrm{store}}
\dealcoloneq
        \begin{bmatrix}
			\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{\textrm{con}}	&	\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{u\widetilde{p}}	& \mathbf{0}
			\\
			\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{\widetilde{p}u}	&	\mathbf{0}	&	\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{\widetilde{p}\widetilde{J}}^{-1}
			\\
			\mathbf{0}	& 	\mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{\widetilde{J}\widetilde{p}}		& \mathbf{\mathsf{K}}_{\widetilde{J}\widetilde{J}}
		\end{bmatrix} \, .

<h3> The material class </h3>

A good object-oriented design of a Material class would facilitate the extension of this tutorial to a wide range of material types.
In this tutorial we simply have one Material class named Material_Compressible_Neo_Hook_Three_Field.
Ideally this class would derive from a class HyperelasticMaterial which would derive from the base class Material.
The three-field nature of the formulation used here also complicates the matter.

The Helmholtz free energy function for the three field formulation is $\Psi = \Psi_\text{vol}(\widetilde{J}) + \Psi_\text{iso}(\overline{\mathbf{b}})$.
The isochoric part of the Kirchhoff stress ${\boldsymbol{\tau}}_{\text{iso}}(\overline{\mathbf{b}})$ is identical to that obtained using a one-field formulation for a hyperelastic material.
However, the volumetric part of the free energy is now a function of the primary variable $\widetilde{J}$.
Thus, for a three field formulation the constitutive response for the volumetric part of the Kirchhoff stress ${\boldsymbol{\tau}}_{\text{vol}}$ (and the tangent) is not given by the hyperelastic constitutive law as in a one-field formulation.
One can label the term
$\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\textrm{vol}} \equiv \widetilde{p} J \mathbf{I}$
as the volumetric Kirchhoff stress, but the pressure $\widetilde{p}$ is not derived from the free energy; it is a primary field.

In order to have a flexible approach, it was decided that the Material_Compressible_Neo_Hook_Three_Field would still be able to calculate and return a volumetric Kirchhoff stress and tangent.
In order to do this, we choose to store the interpolated primary fields $\widetilde{p}$ and $\widetilde{J}$ in the Material_Compressible_Neo_Hook_Three_Field class associated with the quadrature point.
This decision should be revisited at a later stage when the tutorial is extended to account for other materials.


<h3> Numerical example </h3>

The numerical example considered here is a nearly-incompressible block under compression.
This benchmark problem is taken from
- S. Reese, P. Wriggers, B.D. Reddy (2000),
  A new locking-free brick element technique for large deformation problems in elasticity,
  <em> Computers and Structures </em>,
  <strong> 75 </strong>,
  291-304.
  DOI: <a href="http://doi.org/10.1016/S0045-7949(99)00137-6">10.1016/S0045-7949(99)00137-6</a>

 <img src="https://www.dealii.org/images/steps/developer/step-44.setup.png" alt="">

The material is quasi-incompressible neo-Hookean with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_modulus">shear modulus</a> $\mu = 80.194e6$ and $\nu = 0.4999$.
For such a choice of material properties a conventional single-field $Q_1$ approach would lock.
That is, the response would be overly stiff.
The initial and final configurations are shown in the image above.
Using symmetry, we solve for only one quarter of the geometry (i.e. a cube with dimension $0.001$).
The inner-quarter of the upper surface of the domain is subject to a load of $p_0$.


examples/step-44/doc/results.dox
<h1>Results</h1>

Firstly, we present a comparison of a series of 3-d results with those
in the literature (see Reese et al (2000)) to demonstrate that the program works as expected.

We begin with a comparison of the convergence with mesh refinement for the $Q_1-DGPM_0-DGPM_0$ and
$Q_2-DGPM_1-DGPM_1$ formulations, as summarised in the figure below.
The vertical displacement of the midpoint of the upper surface of the block is used to assess convergence.
Both schemes demonstrate good convergence properties for varying values of the load parameter $p/p_0$.
The results agree with those in the literature.
The lower-order formulation typically overestimates the displacement for low levels of refinement,
while the higher-order interpolation scheme underestimates it, but be a lesser degree.
This benchmark, and a series of others not shown here, give us confidence that the code is working
as it should.

A typical screen output generated by running the problem is shown below.
The particular case demonstrated is that of the $Q_2-DGPM_1-DGPM_1$ formulation.
It is clear that, using the Newton-Raphson method, quadratic convergence of the solution is obtained.
Solution convergence is achieved within 5 Newton increments for all time-steps.
The converged displacement's $L_2$-norm is several orders of magnitude less than the geometry scale.

Using the Timer class, we can discern which parts of the code require the highest computational expense.
For a case with a large number of degrees-of-freedom (i.e. a high level of refinement), a typical output of the Timer is given below.
Much of the code in the tutorial has been developed based on the optimizations described,
discussed and demonstrated in Step-18 and others.
With over 93% of the time being spent in the linear solver, it is obvious that it may be necessary
to invest in a better solver for large three-dimensional problems.
The SSOR preconditioner is not multithreaded but is effective for this class of solid problems.
It may be beneficial to investigate the use of another solver such as those available through the Trilinos library.

We then used ParaView to visualize the results for two cases.
The first was for the coarsest grid and the lowest-order interpolation method: $Q_1-DGPM_0-DGPM_0$.
The second was on a refined grid using a $Q_2-DGPM_1-DGPM_1$ formulation.
The vertical component of the displacement, the pressure $\widetilde{p}$ and the dilatation $\widetilde{J}$ fields
are shown below.


For the first case it is clear that the coarse spatial discretization coupled with large displacements leads to a low quality solution
(the loading ratio is  $p/p_0=80$).
Additionally, the pressure difference between elements is very large.
The constant pressure field on the element means that the large pressure gradient is not captured.
However, it should be noted that locking, which would be present in a standard $Q_1$ displacement formulation does not arise
even in this poorly discretised case.
The final vertical displacement of the tracked node on the top surface of the block is still within 12.5% of the converged solution.
The pressure solution is very coarse and has large jumps between adjacent cells.
It is clear that the volume nearest to the applied traction undergoes compression while the outer extents
of the domain are in a state of expansion.
The dilatation solution field and pressure field are clearly linked,
with positive dilatation indicating regions of positive pressure and negative showing regions placed in compression.
As discussed in the Introduction, a compressive pressure has a negative sign
while an expansive pressure takes a positive sign.
This stems from the definition of the volumetric strain energy function
and is opposite to the physically realistic interpretation of pressure.

Combining spatial refinement and a higher-order interpolation scheme results in a high-quality solution.
Three grid refinements coupled with a $Q_2-DGPM_1-DGPM_1$ formulation produces
a result that clearly captures the mechanics of the problem.
The deformation of the traction surface is well resolved.
We can now observe the actual extent of the applied traction, with the maximum force being applied
at the central point of the surface causing the largest compression.
Even though very high strains are experienced in the domain,
especially at the boundary of the region of applied traction,
the solution remains accurate.
The pressure field is captured in far greater detail than before.
There is a clear distinction and transition between regions of compression and expansion,
and the linear approximation of the pressure field allows a refined visualization
of the pressure at the sub-element scale.
It should however be noted that the pressure field remains discontinuous
and could be smoothed on a continuous grid for the post-processing purposes.

This brief analysis of the results demonstrates that the three-field formulation is effective
in circumventing volumetric locking for highly-incompressible media.
The mixed formulation is able to accurately simulate the displacement of a
near-incompressible block under compression.
The command-line output indicates that the volumetric change under extreme compression resulted in
less than 0.01% volume change for a Poisson's ratio of 0.4999.

In terms of run-time, the $Q_2-DGPM_1-DGPM_1$ formulation tends to be more computationally expensive
than the $Q_1-DGPM_0-DGPM_0$ for a similar number of degrees-of-freedom
(produced by adding an extra grid refinement level for the lower-order interpolation).
This is shown in the graph below for a batch of tests run consecutively on a single 4-core (8-thread) machine.
The increase in computational time for the higher-order method is likely due to
the increased band-width required for the higher-order elements.
As previously mentioned, the use of a better solver and preconditioner may mitigate the
expense of using a higher-order formulation.
It was observed that for the given problem using the multithreaded Jacobi preconditioner can reduce the
computational runtime by up to 72% (for the worst case being a higher-order formulation with a large number
of degrees-of-freedom) in comparison to the single-thread SSOR preconditioner.
However, it is the author's experience that the Jacobi method of preconditioning may not be suitable for
some finite-strain problems involving alternative constitutive models.

Lastly, results for the displacement solution for the 2-d problem are showcased below for
two different levels of grid refinement.
It is clear that due to the extra constraints imposed by simulating in 2-d that the resulting
displacement field, although qualitatively similar, is different to that of the 3-d case.

<h3>Possibilities for extensions</h3>

There are a number of obvious extensions for this work:

- Firstly, an additional constraint could be added to the free-energy
  function in order to enforce a high degree of incompressibility in
  materials. An additional Lagrange multiplier would be introduced,
  but this could most easily be dealt with using the principle of
  augmented Lagrange multipliers. This is demonstrated in <em>Simo and
  Taylor (1991) </em>.
- The constitutive relationship used in this
  model is relatively basic. It may be beneficial to split the material
  class into two separate classes, one dealing with the volumetric
  response and the other the isochoric response, and produce a generic
  materials class (i.e. having abstract virtual functions that derived
  classes have to implement) that would allow for the addition of more complex
  material models. Such models could include other hyperelastic
  materials, plasticity and viscoelastic materials and others.
- The program has been developed for solving problems on single-node
  multicore machines. With a little effort, the program could be
  extended to a large-scale computing environment through the use of
  Petsc or Trilinos, using a similar technique to that demonstrated in
  step-40. This would mostly involve changes to the setup, assembly,
  <code>PointHistory</code> and linear solver routines.
- As this program assumes quasi-static equilibrium, extensions to
  include dynamic effects would be necessary to study problems where
  inertial effects are important, e.g. problems involving impact.
- Load and solution limiting procedures may be necessary for highly
  nonlinear problems. It is possible to add a linesearch algorithm to
  limit the step size within a Newton increment to ensure optimum
  convergence. It may also be necessary to use a load limiting method,
  such as the Riks method, to solve unstable problems involving
  geometric instability such as buckling and snap-through.
- Many physical problems involve contact. It is possible to include
  the effect of frictional or frictionless contact between objects
  into this program. This would involve the addition of an extra term
  in the free-energy functional and therefore an addition to the
  assembly routine. One would also need to manage the contact problem
  (detection and stress calculations) itself. An alternative to
  additional penalty terms in the free-energy functional would be to
  use active set methods such as the one used in step-41.
- The complete condensation procedure using LinearOperators has been
  coded into the linear solver routine. This could also have been
  achieved through the application of the schur_complement()
  operator to condense out one or more of the fields in a more
  automated manner.
- Finally, adaptive mesh refinement, as demonstrated in step-6 and
  step-18, could provide additional solution accuracy.
