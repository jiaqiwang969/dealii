After we have created a grid in the previous example, we now show how
to define degrees of freedom on this mesh. For this example, we
will use the lowest order ($Q_1$) finite elements, for which the degrees
of freedom are associated with the vertices of the mesh. Later
examples will demonstrate higher order elements where degrees of freedom are
not necessarily associated with vertices any more, but can be associated
with edges, faces, or cells.

The term "degree of freedom" is commonly used in the finite element community
to indicate two slightly different, but related things. The first is that we'd
like to represent the finite element solution as a linear combination of shape
functions, in the form $u_h(\mathbf x) = \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} U_j \varphi_j(\mathbf
x)$. Here, $U_j$ is a vector of expansion coefficients. Because we don't know
their values yet (we will compute them as the solution of a linear or
nonlinear system), they are called "unknowns" or "degrees of freedom". The
second meaning of the term can be explained as follows: A mathematical
description of finite element problems is often to say that we are looking for
a finite dimensional function $u_h \in V_h$ that satisfies some set of equations
(e.g. $a(u_h,\varphi_h)=(f,\varphi_h)$ for all test functions $\varphi_h\in
V_h$). In other words, all we say here that the solution needs to lie in some
space $V_h$. However, to actually solve this problem on a computer we need to
choose a basis of this space; this is the set of shape functions
$\varphi_j(\mathbf x)$ we have used above in the expansion of $u_h(\mathbf x)$
with coefficients $U_j$. There are of course many bases of the space $V_h$,
but we will specifically choose the one that is described by the finite
element functions that are traditionally defined locally on the cells of the
mesh. Describing "degrees of freedom" in this context requires us to simply
<i>enumerate</i> the basis functions of the space $V_h$. For $Q_1$ elements
this means simply enumerating the vertices of the mesh in some way, but for
higher order elements, one also has to enumerate the shape functions that are
associated with edges, faces, or cell interiors of the mesh. In other words,
the enumeration of degrees of freedom is an entirely separate thing from the
indices we use for vertices. The class that
provides this enumeration of the basis functions of $V_h$ is called DoFHandler.

Defining degrees of freedom ("DoF"s in short) on a mesh is a rather
simple task, since the library does all the work for you. Essentially,
all you have to do is create a finite element object (from one of the
many finite element classes deal.II already has, see for example the
@ref fe documentation) and give it to a DoFHandler object through the
DoFHandler::distribute_dofs function ("distributing DoFs" is the term we use
to describe the process of <i>enumerating</i> the basis functions as discussed
above). The DoFHandler is a class that
knows which degrees of freedom live where, i.e., it can answer
questions like "how many degrees of freedom are there globally" and
"on this cell, give me the global indices of the shape functions that
live here". This is the sort of information you need when determining
how big your system matrix should be, and when copying the
contributions of a single cell into the global matrix.

<h3> Sparsity </h3>

The next step would then be to compute a matrix and right hand side
corresponding to a particular differential equation using this finite element
and mesh. We will keep this step for the step-3 program and rather talk about
one practical aspect of a finite element program, namely that finite element
matrices are always very sparse: almost all entries in these
matrices are zero.

To be more precise, we say that a matrix is sparse
if the number of nonzero entries <i>per row</i> in the matrix is
bounded by a number that is independent of the overall number of degrees of
freedom. For example, the simple 5-point stencil of a finite difference
approximation of the Laplace equation leads to a sparse matrix since the
number of nonzero entries per row is five, and therefore independent of the
total size of the matrix. For more complicated problems -- say, the Stokes
problem of step-22 -- and in particular in 3d, the number of entries per row
may be several hundred. But the important point is that this number is
independent of the overall size of the problem: If you refine the mesh, the
maximal number of unknowns per row remains the same.

Sparsity is one of the distinguishing feature of
the finite element method compared to, say, approximating the solution of a
partial differential equation using a Taylor expansion and matching
coefficients, or using a Fourier basis.

In practical terms, it is the sparsity of matrices that enables us to solve
problems with millions or billions of unknowns. To understand this, note that
a matrix with $N$ rows, each with a fixed upper bound for the number of
nonzero entries, requires ${\cal O}(N)$ memory locations for storage, and a
matrix-vector multiplication also requires only ${\cal O}(N)$
operations. Consequently, if we had a linear solver that requires only a fixed
number of matrix-vector multiplications to come up with the solution of a
linear system with this matrix, then we would have a solver that can find the
values of all $N$ unknowns with optimal complexity, i.e., with a total of
${\cal O}(N)$ operations. It is clear that this wouldn't be possible if the
matrix were not sparse (because then the number of entries in the matrix would
have to be ${\cal O}(N^s)$ with some $s>1$, and doing a fixed number of
matrix-vector products would take ${\cal O}(N^s)$ operations),
but it also requires very specialized solvers such as
multigrid methods to satisfy the requirement that the solution requires only a
fixed number of matrix-vector multiplications. We will frequently look at the
question of what solver to use in the remaining programs of this tutorial.

The sparsity is generated by the fact that finite element shape
functions are defined <i>locally</i> on individual cells, rather than
globally, and that the local differential operators in the bilinear
form only couple shape functions whose support overlaps. (The "support" of
a function is the area where it is nonzero. For the finite element method,
the support of a shape function is generally the cells adjacent to the vertex,
edge, or face it is defined on.) In other words, degrees of freedom $i$ and $j$
that are not defined on the same cell do not overlap, and consequently
the matrix entry $A_{ij}$ will be zero.  (In some cases such
as the Discontinuous Galerkin method, shape functions may also connect
to neighboring cells through face integrals. But finite element
methods do not generally couple shape functions beyond the immediate
neighbors of a cell on which the function is defined.)


<h3> How degrees of freedom are enumerated </h3>

By default, the DoFHandler class enumerates degrees of freedom on a mesh in a
rather random way; consequently, the sparsity pattern is also not
optimized for any particular purpose. To show this, the code below will
demonstrate a simple way to output the "sparsity pattern" that corresponds to
a DoFHandler, i.e., an object that represents all of the potentially nonzero
elements of a matrix one may build when discretizing a partial differential
equation on a mesh and its DoFHandler. This lack of structure in the sparsity
pattern will be apparent from the pictures we show below.

For most applications and algorithms, the exact way in which degrees of freedom
are numbered does not matter. For example, the Conjugate Gradient method we
use to solve linear systems does not care. On the other hand,
some algorithms do care: in particular, some preconditioners such as SSOR
will work better if they can walk through degrees of freedom in a particular
order, and it would be nice if we could just sort them in such a way that
SSOR can iterate through them from zero to $N$ in this order. Other examples
include computing incomplete LU or Cholesky factorizations, or if we care
about the block structure of matrices (see step-20 for an example).
deal.II therefore has algorithms that can re-enumerate degrees of freedom
in particular ways in namespace DoFRenumbering. Renumbering can be thought
of as choosing a different, permuted basis of the finite element space. The
sparsity pattern and matrices that result from this renumbering are therefore
also simply a permutation of rows and columns compared to the ones we would
get without explicit renumbering.

In the program below, we will use the algorithm of Cuthill and McKee to do
so. We will show the sparsity pattern for both the original enumeration of
degrees of freedom and of the renumbered version below,
in the <a href="#Results">results section</a>.

<h1>Results</h1>

The program has, after having been run, produced two sparsity
patterns. We can visualize them by opening the <code>.svg</code> files in a web browser.

The results then look like this (every point denotes an entry which
might be nonzero; of course the fact whether the entry actually is
zero or not depends on the equation under consideration, but the
indicated positions in the matrix tell us which shape functions can
and which can't couple when discretizing a local, i.e. differential,
equation):

  </tr>
</table>

The different regions in the left picture, indicated by kinks in the lines and
single dots on the left and top, represent the degrees of
freedom on the different refinement levels of the triangulation.  As
can be seen in the right picture, the sparsity pattern is much better
clustered around the main diagonal of the matrix after
renumbering. Although this might not be apparent, the number of
nonzero entries is the same in both pictures, of course.



<h3> Possibilities for extensions </h3>

Just as with step-1, you may want to play with the program a bit to
familiarize yourself with deal.II. For example, in the
<code>distribute_dofs</code> function, we use linear finite elements
(that's what the argument "1" to the FE_Q object is). Explore how the
sparsity pattern changes if you use higher order elements, for example
cubic or quintic ones (by using 3 and 5 as the respective arguments).

You could also explore how the sparsity pattern changes by refining
the mesh. You will see that not only the size of the matrix
changes, but also its bandwidth (the distance from the diagonal of
those nonzero elements of the matrix that are farthest away from the
diagonal), though the ratio of bandwidth to size typically shrinks,
i.e. the matrix clusters more around the diagonal.

Another idea of experiments would be to try other renumbering
strategies than Cuthill-McKee from the DoFRenumbering namespace and see how
they affect the sparsity pattern.

You can also visualize the output using <a
href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">GNUPLOT</a> (one of the simpler visualization
programs; maybe not the easiest to use since it is command line driven, but
also universally available on all Linux and other Unix-like systems) by changing from <code>print_svg()</code> to <code>print_gnuplot()</code> in <code>distribute_dofs()</code> and <code>renumber_dofs()</code>:

Another practice based on
<a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/">GNUPLOT</a> is trying to
print out the mesh with locations and numbering of the support
points. For that, you need to include header files for GridOut and MappingQ1.
The code for this is:
@code
  std::ofstream out("gnuplot.gpl");
  out << "plot '-' using 1:2 with lines, "
      << "'-' with labels point pt 2 offset 1,1"
      << std::endl;
  GridOut().write_gnuplot (triangulation, out);
  out << "e" << std::endl;
  const int dim = 2;
  std::map<types::global_dof_index, Point<dim> > support_points;
  DoFTools::map_dofs_to_support_points (MappingQ1<dim>(),
                                        dof_handler,
                                        support_points);
  DoFTools::write_gnuplot_dof_support_point_info(out,
                                                 support_points);
  out << "e" << std::endl;
@endcode
After we run the code, we get a file called gnuplot.gpl. To view this
file, we can run the following code in the command line:
@code
gnuplot -p gnuplot.gpl
@endcode.
With that, you will get a picture similar to
@image html support_point_dofs1.png
depending on the mesh you are looking at. For more information, see DoFTools::write_gnuplot_dof_support_point_info.
