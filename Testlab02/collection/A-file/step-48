<h1>Introduction</h1>

This program demonstrates how to use the cell-based implementation of finite
element operators with the MatrixFree class, first introduced in step-37, to
solve nonlinear partial differential equations. Moreover, we have another look
at the handling of constraints within the matrix-free framework.
Finally, we will use an explicit time-stepping
method to solve the problem and introduce Gauss-Lobatto finite elements that
are very convenient in this case since their mass matrix can be accurately
approximated by a diagonal, and thus trivially invertible, matrix. The two
ingredients to this property are firstly a distribution of the nodal points of
Lagrange polynomials according to the point distribution of the Gauss-Lobatto
quadrature rule. Secondly, the quadrature is done with the same Gauss-Lobatto
quadrature rule. In this formula, the integrals $\int_K \varphi_i \varphi_j
dx\approx \sum_q \varphi_i \varphi_j \mathrm{det}(J) \big |_{x_q}$ become
zero whenever $i\neq j$, because exactly one function $\varphi_j$ is one and
all others zero in the points defining the Lagrange polynomials.
Moreover, the Gauss-Lobatto distribution of nodes of Lagrange
polynomials clusters the nodes towards the element boundaries. This results in
a well-conditioned polynomial basis for high-order discretization
methods. Indeed, the condition number of an FE_Q elements with equidistant
nodes grows exponentially with the degree, which destroys any benefit for
orders of about five and higher. For this reason, Gauss-Lobatto points are the
default distribution for the FE_Q element (but at degrees one and two, those
are equivalent to the equidistant points).

<h3> Problem statement and discretization </h3>

As an example, we choose to solve the sine-Gordon soliton equation
\f{eqnarray*}
u_{tt} &=& \Delta u -\sin(u) \quad\mbox{for}\quad (x,t) \in
\Omega \times (t_0,t_f],\\
{\mathbf n} \cdot \nabla u &=& 0
\quad\mbox{for}\quad (x,t) \in \partial\Omega \times (t_0,t_f],\\
u(x,t_0) &=& u_0(x).
\f}

that was already introduced in step-25. As a simple explicit time
integration method, we choose leap frog scheme using the second-order
formulation of the equation. With this time stepping, the scheme reads in
weak form

\f{eqnarray*}
(v,u^{n+1}) = (v,2 u^n-u^{n-1} -
(\Delta t)^2 \sin(u^n)) - (\nabla v, (\Delta t)^2 \nabla u^n),
\f}
where <i> v</i> denotes a test function and the index <i>n</i> stands for
the time step number.

For the spatial discretization, we choose FE_Q elements
with basis functions defined to interpolate the support points of the
Gauss-Lobatto quadrature rule. Moreover, when we compute the integrals
over the basis functions to form the mass matrix and the operator on
the right hand side of the equation above, we use the
Gauss-Lobatto quadrature rule with the same support points as the
node points of the finite element to evaluate the integrals. Since the
finite element is Lagrangian, this will yield a diagonal mass matrix
on the left hand side of the equation, making the solution of the
linear system in each time step trivial.

Using this quadrature rule, for a <i>p</i>th order finite element, we use a
<i>(2p-1)</i>th order accurate formula to evaluate the integrals. Since the
product of two <i>p</i>th order basis functions when computing a mass matrix
gives a function with polynomial degree <i>2p</i> in each direction, the
integrals are not computed exactly.  However, the overall convergence
properties are not disturbed by the quadrature error on meshes with affine
element shapes with L2 errors proportional to <i>h<sup>p+1</sup></i>. Note
however that order reduction with sub-optimal convergence rates of the L2
error of <i>O(h<sup>p</sup>)</i> or even <i>O(h<sup>p-1</sup>)</i> for some 3D
setups has been reported <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/num.20353">in
literature</a> on deformed (non-affine) element shapes for wave equations
when the integrand is not a polynomial any more.

Apart from the fact that we avoid solving linear systems with this
type of elements when using explicit time-stepping, they come with two
other advantages. When we are using the sum-factorization approach to
evaluate the finite element operator (cf. step-37), we have to
evaluate the function at the quadrature points. In the case of
Gauss-Lobatto elements, where quadrature points and node points of the
finite element coincide, this operation is trivial since the value
of the function at the quadrature points is given by its one-dimensional
coefficients. In this way, the arithmetic work for the finite element operator
evaluation is reduced by approximately a factor of two compared to the generic
Gaussian quadrature.

To sum up the discussion, by using the right finite element and
quadrature rule combination, we end up with a scheme where we
only need to compute the right hand side vector corresponding
to the formulation above and then multiply it by the inverse of the
diagonal mass matrix in each time step. In practice, of course, we extract
the diagonal elements and invert them only once at the beginning of the
program.

<h3>Implementation of constraints</h3>

The usual way to handle constraints in <code>deal.II</code> is to use
the AffineConstraints class that builds a sparse matrix storing
information about which degrees of freedom (DoF) are constrained and
how they are constrained. This format uses an unnecessarily large
amount of memory since there are not so many different types of
constraints: for example, in the case of hanging nodes when using
linear finite element on every cell, most constraints have the form
$x_k = \frac 12 x_i + \frac 12 x_j$ where the coefficients $\frac 12$
are always the same and only $i,j,k$ are different. While storing this
redundant information is not a problem in general because it is only
needed once during matrix and right hand side assembly, it becomes a
bottleneck in the matrix-free approach since there this
information has to be accessed every time we apply the operator, and the
remaining components of the operator evaluation are so fast. Thus,
instead of an AffineConstraints object, MatrixFree uses a variable that
we call <code>constraint_pool</code> that collects the weights of the
different constraints. Then, only an identifier of each constraint in the
mesh instead of all the weights have to be stored. Moreover,
the constraints are not applied in a pre- and postprocessing step
but rather as we evaluate the finite element
operator. Therefore, the constraint information is embedded into the
variable <code>indices_local_to_global</code> that is used to extract
the cell information from the global vector. If a DoF is constrained,
the <code>indices_local_to_global</code> variable contains the global
indices of the DoFs that it is constrained to. Then, we have another
variable <code>constraint_indicator</code> at hand that holds, for
each cell, the local indices of DoFs that are constrained as well as
the identifier of the type of constraint. Fortunately, you will not see
these data structures in the example program since the class
<code>FEEvaluation</code> takes care of the constraints without user
interaction.

In the presence of hanging nodes, the diagonal mass matrix obtained on the
element level via the Gauss-Lobatto quadrature/node point procedure does not
directly translate to a diagonal global mass matrix, as following the
constraints on rows and columns would also add off-diagonal entries. As
explained in <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.4208/cicp.101214.021015a">Kormann
(2016)</a>, interpolating constraints on a vector, which maintains the
diagonal shape of the mass matrix, is consistent with the equations up to an
error of the same magnitude as the quadrature error. In the program below, we
will simply assemble the diagonal of the mass matrix as if it were a vector to
enable this approximation.


<h3> Parallelization </h3>

The MatrixFree class comes with the option to be parallelized on three levels:
MPI parallelization on clusters of distributed nodes, thread parallelization
scheduled by the Threading Building Blocks library, and finally with a
vectorization by working on a batch of two (or more) cells via SIMD data type
(sometimes called cross-element or external vectorization).
As we have already discussed in step-37, you will
get best performance by using an instruction set specific to your system,
e.g. with the cmake variable <tt>-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-march=native"</tt>. The
MPI parallelization was already exploited in step-37. Here, we additionally
consider thread parallelization with TBB. This is fairly simple, as all we
need to do is to tell the initialization of the MatrixFree object about the
fact that we want to use a thread parallel scheme through the variable
MatrixFree::AdditionalData::thread_parallel_scheme. During setup, a dependency
graph is set up similar to the one described in the @ref workstream_paper ,
which allows to schedule the work of the @p local_apply function on chunks of
cells without several threads accessing the same vector indices. As opposed to
the WorkStream loops, some additional clever tricks to avoid global
synchronizations as described in <a
href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/eScience.2011.53">Kormann and Kronbichler
(2011)</a> are also applied.

Note that this program is designed to be run with a distributed triangulation
(parallel::distributed::Triangulation), which requires deal.II to be
configured with <a href="http://www.p4est.org/">p4est</a> as described
in the <a href="../../readme.html">deal.II ReadMe</a> file. However, a
non-distributed triangulation is also supported, in which case the
computation will be run in serial.

<h3> The test case </h3>

In our example, we choose the initial value to be \f{eqnarray*} u(x,t) =
\prod_{i=1}^{d} -4 \arctan \left(
\frac{m}{\sqrt{1-m^2}}\frac{\sin\left(\sqrt{1-m^2} t +c_2\right)}{\cosh(mx_i+c_1)}\right)
\f} and solve the equation over the time interval [-10,10]. The
constants are chosen to be $c_1=c_1=0$ and <i> m=0.5</i>. As mentioned
in step-25, in one dimension <i>u</i> as a function of <i>t</i> is the exact
solution of the sine-Gordon equation. For higher dimension, this is however
not the case.

<h1>Results</h1>

<h3>Comparison with a sparse matrix</h3>

In order to demonstrate the gain in using the MatrixFree class instead of
the standard <code>deal.II</code> assembly routines for evaluating the
information from old time steps, we study a simple serial run of the code on a
nonadaptive mesh. Since much time is spent on evaluating the sine function, we
do not only show the numbers of the full sine-Gordon equation but also for the
wave equation (the sine-term skipped from the sine-Gordon equation). We use
both second and fourth order elements. The results are summarized in the
following table.

It is apparent that the matrix-free code outperforms the standard assembly
routines in deal.II by far. In 3D and for fourth order elements, one operator
evaluation is also almost ten times as fast as a sparse matrix-vector
product.

In 3D, the respective output looks like
@code

@endcode

It takes 0.008 seconds for one time step with more than a million
degrees of freedom (note that we would need many processors to reach such
numbers when solving linear systems).

If we replace the thread-parallelization by a pure MPI parallelization, the
timings change into:
@code
\$ mpirun -n 24 ./step-48
Number of MPI ranks:            24
Number of threads on each rank: 1
Vectorization over 4 doubles = 256 bits (AVX)
...
   Performed 1706 time steps.
   Average wallclock time per time step: 0.0051747s
   Spent 2.0535s on output and 8.828s on computations.
@endcode

We observe a dramatic speedup for the output (which makes sense, given that
most code of the output is not parallelized via threads, whereas it is for
MPI), but less than the theoretical factor of 12 we would expect from the
parallelism. More interestingly, the computations also get faster when
switching from the threads-only variant to the MPI-only variant. This is a
general observation for the MatrixFree framework (as of updating this data in
2019). The main reason is that the decisions regarding work on conflicting
cell batches made to enable execution in parallel are overly pessimistic:
While they ensure that no work on neighboring cells is done on different
threads at the same time, this conservative setting implies that data from
neighboring cells is also evicted from caches by the time neighbors get
touched. Furthermore, the current scheme is not able to provide a constant
load for all 24 threads for the given mesh with 17,592 cells.

The current program allows to also mix MPI parallelization with thread
parallelization. This is most beneficial when running programs on clusters
with multiple nodes, using MPI for the inter-node parallelization and threads
for the intra-node parallelization. On the workstation used above, we can run
threads in the hyperthreading region (i.e., using 2 threads for each of the 12
MPI ranks). An important setting for mixing MPI with threads is to ensure
proper binning of tasks to CPUs. On many clusters the placing is either
automatically via the `mpirun/mpiexec` environment, or there can be manual
settings. Here, we simply report the run times the plain version of the
program (noting that things could be improved towards the timings of the
MPI-only program when proper pinning is done):

<h3>Possibilities for extensions</h3>

There are several things in this program that could be improved to make it
even more efficient (besides improved boundary conditions and physical
stuff as discussed in step-25):

<ul> <li> <b>Faster evaluation of sine terms:</b> As becomes obvious
  from the comparison of the plain wave equation and the sine-Gordon
  equation above, the evaluation of the sine terms dominates the total
  time for the finite element operator application. There are a few
  reasons for this: Firstly, the deal.II sine computation of a
  VectorizedArray field is not vectorized (as opposed to the rest of
  the operator application). This could be cured by handing the sine
  computation to a library with vectorized sine computations like
  Intel's math kernel library (MKL). By using the function
  <code>vdSin</code> in MKL, the program uses half the computing time
  in 2D and 40 percent less time in 3D. On the other hand, the sine
  computation is structurally much more complicated than the simple
  arithmetic operations like additions and multiplications in the rest
  of the local operation.

  <li> <b>Higher order time stepping:</b> While the implementation allows for
  arbitrary order in the spatial part (by adjusting the degree of the finite
  element), the time stepping scheme is a standard second-order leap-frog
  scheme. Since solutions in wave propagation problems are usually very
  smooth, the error is likely dominated by the time stepping part. Of course,
  this could be cured by using smaller time steps (at a fixed spatial
  resolution), but it would be more efficient to use higher order time
  stepping as well. While it would be straight-forward to do so for a
  first-order system (use some Runge&ndash;Kutta scheme of higher order,
  probably combined with adaptive time step selection like the <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dormand%E2%80%93Prince_method">Dormand&ndash;Prince
  method</a>), it is more challenging for the second-order formulation. At
  least in the finite difference community, people usually use the PDE to find
  spatial correction terms that improve the temporal error.

</ul>
