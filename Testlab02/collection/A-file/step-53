<h1>Introduction</h1>

Partial differential equations for realistic problems are often posed on
domains with complicated geometries. To provide just a few examples, consider
these cases:
- Among the two arguably most important industrial applications for the finite
  element method, aerodynamics and more generally fluid dynamics is
  one. Computer simulations today are used in the design of every airplane,
  car, train and ship. The domain in which the partial differential equation
  is posed is, in these cases, the air surrounding the plane with its wings,
  flaps and engines; the air surrounding the car with its wheel, wheel wells,
  mirrors and, in the case of race cars, all sorts of aerodynamic equipment;
  the air surrounding the train with its wheels and gaps between cars. In the
  case of ships, the domain is the water surrounding the ship with its rudders
  and propellers.
- The other of the two big applications of the finite element method is
  structural engineering in which the domains are bridges, airplane nacelles
  and wings, and other solid bodies of often complicated shapes.
- Finite element modeling is also often used to describe the generation and
  propagation of earthquake waves. In these cases, one needs to accurately
  represent the geometry of faults in the Earth crust. Since faults intersect,
  dip at angles, and are often not completely straight, domains are frequently
  very complex.
One could cite many more examples of complicated geometries in which one wants
to pose and solve a partial differential equation. What this shows is that the
"real" world is much more complicated than what we have shown in almost all of
the tutorial programs preceding this one.

This program is therefore devoted to showing how one deals with complex
geometries using a concrete application. In particular, what it shows is how
we make a mesh fit the domain we want to solve on. On the other hand, what the
program does not show is how to create a coarse for a domain. The process to
arrive at a coarse mesh is called "mesh generation" and there are a number of
high-quality programs that do this much better than we could ever
implement. However, deal.II does have the ability to read in meshes in many
formats generated by mesh generators and then make them fit a given shape,
either by deforming a mesh or refining it a number of times until it fits. The
deal.II Frequently Asked Questions page referenced from http://www.dealii.org/
provides resources to mesh generators.


<h3>Where geometry and meshes intersect</h3>

Let us assume that you have a complex domain and that you already have a
coarse mesh that somehow represents the general features of the domain. Then
there are two situations in which it is necessary to describe to a deal.II
program the details of your geometry:

- Mesh refinement: Whenever a cell is refined, it is necessary to introduce
  new vertices in the Triangulation. In the simplest case, one assumes that
  the objects that make up the Triangulation are straight line segments, a
  bi-linear surface or a tri-linear volume. The next vertex is then simply put
  into the middle of the old ones. However, for curved boundaries or if we
  want to solve a PDE on a curved, lower-dimensional manifold embedded in a
  higher-dimensional space, this is insufficient since it will not respect the
  actual geometry. We will therefore have to tell Triangulation where to put
  new points.

- Integration: When using higher order finite element methods, it is often
  necessary to compute integrals using curved approximations of the boundary,
  i.e., describe each edge or face of cells as curves, instead of straight
  line segments or bilinear patches. The same is, of course, true when
  integrating boundary terms (e.g., inhomogeneous Neumann boundary
  conditions). For the purpose of integration, the various Mapping classes
  then provide the transformation from the reference cell to the actual cell.

In both cases, we need a way to provide information about the geometry of the
domain at the level of an individual cell, its faces and edges. This is where
the Manifold class comes into play. Manifold is an abstract base class that
only defines an interface by which the Triangulation and Mapping classes can
query geometric information about the domain. Conceptually, Manifold sees the
world in a way not dissimilar to how the mathematical subdiscipline geometry
sees it: a domain is essentially just a collection of points that is somehow
equipped with the notion of a distance between points so that we can obtain a
point "in the middle" of some other points.

deal.II provides a number of classes that implement the interface provided by
Manifold for a variety of common geometries. On the other hand, in this
program we will consider only a very common and much simpler case, namely the
situation where (a part of) the domain we want to solve on can be described by
transforming a much simpler domain (we will call this the "reference domain").
In the language of mathematics, this means
that the (part of the) domain is a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chart_%28topology%29">chart</a>. Charts are
described by a smooth function that maps from the simpler domain to the chart
(the "push-forward" function) and its inverse (the "pull-back" function). If
the domain as a whole is not a chart (e.g., the surface of a sphere), then it
can often be described as a collection of charts (e.g., the northern
hemisphere and the southern hemisphere are each charts) and the domain can then
be describe by an <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_%28topology%29">atlas</a>.

If a domain can be decomposed into an atlas, all we need to do is provide the
pull-back and push-forward functions for each of the charts. In deal.II, this
means providing a class derived from ChartManifold, and this is precisely what
we will do in this program.


<h3>The example case</h3>

To illustrate how one describes geometries using charts in deal.II, we will
consider a case that originates in an application of the <a
href="https://aspect.geodynamics.org">ASPECT mantle convection code</a>, using a
data set provided by D. Sarah Stamps. In the concrete application, we were
interested in describing flow in the Earth mantle under the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_African_rift">East African Rift</a>, a
zone where two continental plates drift apart. Not to beat around the bush,
the geometry we want to describe looks like this:

<img src="https://www.dealii.org/images/steps/developer/step-53.topo.png" alt="">

In particular, though you cannot see this here, the top surface is not
just colored by the elevation but is, in fact, deformed to follow the
correct topography.
While the actual application is not relevant here, the geometry is. The domain
we are interested in is a part of the Earth that ranges from the surface to a
depth of 500km, from 26 to 35 degrees East of the Greenwich meridian, and from
5 degrees North of the equator to 10 degrees South.

This description of the geometry suggests to start with a box
$\hat U=[26,35]\times[-10,5]\times[-500000,0]$ (measured in degrees,
degrees, and meters) and to provide a map $\varphi$ so
that $\varphi^{-1}(\hat U)=\Omega$ where $\Omega$ is the domain we
seek. $(\Omega,\varphi)$ is then a chart, $\varphi$ the pull-back operator, and
$\varphi^{-1}$ the push-forward operator. If we need a point $q$ that is the
"average" of other points $q_i\in\Omega$, the ChartManifold class then first
applies the pull-back to obtain $\hat q_i=\varphi(q_i)$, averages these to a
point $\hat p$ and then computes $p=\varphi^{-1}(\hat p)$.

Our goal here is therefore to implement a class that describes $\varphi$ and
$\varphi^{-1}$. If Earth was a sphere, then this would not be difficult: if we
denote by $(\hat \phi,\hat \theta,\hat d)$ the points of $\hat U$ (i.e.,
longitude counted eastward, latitude counted northward, and elevation relative
to zero depth), then
@f[
  \mathbf x = \varphi^{-1}(\hat \phi,\hat \theta,\hat d)
  = (R+\hat d) (\cos\hat \phi\cos\hat \theta, \sin\hat \phi\cos\hat \theta, \sin\hat \theta)^T
@f]
provides coordinates in a Cartesian coordinate system, where $R$ is the radius
of the sphere. However, the Earth is not a sphere:

<ol>
<li> It is flattened at the poles and larger at the equator: the semi-major axis
  is approximately 22km longer than the semi-minor axis. We will account for
  this using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGS84">WGS 84</a>
  reference standard for the Earth shape. The formula used in WGS 84 to obtain
  a position in Cartesian coordinates from longitude, latitude, and elevation
  is
@f[
  \mathbf x = \varphi_\text{WGS84}^{-1}(\phi,\theta,d)
  = \left(
    \begin{array}{c}
     (\bar R(\theta)+d) \cos\phi\cos\theta, \\
     (\bar R(\theta)+d) \sin\phi\cos\theta, \\
     ((1-e^2)\bar R(\theta)+d) \sin\theta
    \end{array}
    \right),
@f]
  where $\bar R(\theta)=\frac{R}{\sqrt{1-(e \sin\theta)^2}}$, and radius and
  ellipticity are given by $R=6378137\text{m}, e=0.081819190842622$. In this formula,
  we assume that the arguments to sines and cosines are evaluated in degree, not
  radians (though we will have to change this assumption in the code).

<li> It has topography in the form of mountains and valleys. We will account for
  this using real topography data (see below for a description of where
  this data comes from). Using this data set, we can look up elevations on a
  latitude-longitude mesh laid over the surface of the Earth. Starting with
  the box $\hat U=[26,35]\times[-10,5]\times[-500000,0]$, we will therefore
  first stretch it in vertical direction before handing it off to the WGS 84
  function: if $h(\hat\phi,\hat\theta)$ is the height at longitude $\hat\phi$
  and latitude $\hat\theta$, then we define
@f[
  (\phi,\theta,d) =
  \varphi_\text{topo}^{-1}(\hat\phi,\hat\theta,\hat d)
  = \left(
      \hat\phi,
      \hat\theta,
      \hat d + \frac{\hat d+500000}{500000}h(\hat\phi,\hat\theta)
    \right).
@f]
  Using this function, the top surface of the box $\hat U$ is displaced to the
  correct topography, the bottom surface remains where it was, and points in
  between are linearly interpolated.
</ol>

Using these two functions, we can then define the entire push-forward function
$\varphi^{-1}: \hat U \rightarrow \Omega$ as
@f[
  \mathbf x
  =
  \varphi^{-1}(\hat\phi,\hat\theta,\hat d)
  =
  \varphi_\text{WGS84}^{-1}(\varphi_\text{topo}^{-1}(\hat\phi,\hat\theta,\hat d)).
@f]
In addition, we will have to define the inverse of this function, the
pull-back operation, which we can write as
@f[
  (\hat\phi,\hat\theta,\hat d)
  =
  \varphi(\mathbf x)
  =
  \varphi_\text{topo}(\varphi_\text{WGS84}(\mathbf x)).
@f]
We can obtain one of the components of this function by inverting the formula above:
@f[
  (\hat\phi,\hat\theta,\hat d) =
  \varphi_\text{topo}(\phi,\theta,d)
  = \left(
      \phi,
      \theta,
      500000\frac{d-h(\phi,\theta)}{500000+h(\phi,\theta)}
    \right).
@f]
Computing $\varphi_\text{WGS84}(\mathbf x)$ is also possible though a lot more
awkward. We won't show the formula here but instead only provide the implementation
in the program.


<h3>Implementation</h3>

There are a number of issues we need to address in the program. At the largest scale,
we need to write a class that implements the interface of ChartManifold. This involves
a function <code>push_forward()</code> that takes a point
in the reference domain $\hat U$ and transform it into real space using the function
$\varphi^{-1}$ outlined above, and its inverse function <code>pull_back()</code>
implementing $\varphi$. We will do so in the <code>AfricaGeometry</code> class below
that looks, in essence, like this:
@code
  class AfricaGeometry : public ChartManifold<3,3>
  {
  public:
    virtual
    Point<3>
    pull_back(const Point<3> &space_point) const;

    virtual
    Point<3>
    push_forward(const Point<3> &chart_point) const;

  private:
    ... some member variables and other member functions...;
  };
@endcode

The transformations above have two parts: the WGS 84 transformations and the topography
transformation. Consequently, the <code>AfricaGeometry</code> class will have
additional (non-virtual) member functions
<code>AfricaGeometry::push_forward_wgs84()</code> and
<code>AfricaGeometry::push_forward_topo()</code> that implement these two pieces, and
corresponding pull back functions.

The WGS 84 transformation functions are not particularly interesting (even though the
formulas they implement are impressive). The more interesting part is the topography
transformation. Recall that for this, we needed to evaluate the elevation function
$h(\hat\phi,\hat\theta)$. There is of course no formula for this: Earth is what it is,
the best one can do is look up the altitude from some table. This is, in fact what we
will do.

The data we use was originally created by the  <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Radar_Topography_Mission">Shuttle
Radar Topography Mission</a>, was downloaded from the US Geologic Survey
(USGS) and processed by D. Sarah Stamps who also wrote the initial version of
the WGS 84 transformation functions. The topography data so processed is
stored in a file <code>topography.txt.gz</code> that, when unpacked
looks like this:
@code
6.983333 25.000000 700
6.983333 25.016667 692
6.983333 25.033333 701
6.983333 25.050000 695
6.983333 25.066667 710
6.983333 25.083333 702
...
-11.983333 35.950000 707
-11.983333 35.966667 687
-11.983333 35.983333 659
@endcode
The data is formatted as <code>latitude longitude elevation</code> where the first two
columns are provided in degrees North of the equator and degrees East of the Greenwich
meridian. The final column is given in meters above the WGS 84 zero elevation.

In the transformation functions, we need to evaluate $h(\hat\phi,\hat\theta)$ for a given
longitude $\hat\phi$ and latitude $\hat\theta$. In general, this data point will not be
available and we will have to interpolate between adjacent data points. Writing such an
interpolation routine is not particularly difficult, but it is a bit tedious and error
prone. Fortunately, we can somehow shoehorn this data set into an existing class:
Functions::InterpolatedUniformGridData . Unfortunately, the class does not fit the bill
quite exactly and so we need to work around it a bit. The problem comes from the way
we initialize this class: in its simplest form, it takes a stream of values that it
assumes form an equispaced mesh in the $x-y$ plane (or, here, the $\phi-\theta$ plane).
Which is what they do here, sort of: they are ordered latitude first, longitude second;
and more awkwardly, the first column starts at the largest values and counts down,
rather than the usual other way around.

Now, while tutorial programs are meant to illustrate how to code with deal.II, they do
not necessarily have to satisfy the same quality standards as one would have to do
with production codes. In a production code, we would write a function that reads the
data and (i) automatically determines the extents of the first and second column,
(ii) automatically determines the number of data points in each direction, (iii) does
the interpolation regardless of the order in which data is arranged, if necessary
by switching the order between reading and presenting it to the
Functions::InterpolatedUniformGridData class.

On the other hand, tutorial programs are best if they are short and demonstrate key
points rather than dwell on unimportant aspects and, thereby, obscure what we really
want to show. Consequently, we will allow ourselves a bit of leeway:
- since this program is intended solely for a particular geometry around the area
  of the East-African rift and since this is precisely the area described by the data
  file, we will hardcode in the program that there are
  $1139\times 660$ pieces of data;
- we will hardcode the boundaries of the data
  $[-11.98333^\circ,6.983333^\circ]\times[25^\circ,35.98333^\circ]$;
- we will lie to the Functions::InterpolatedUniformGridData class: the class will
  only see the data in the last column of this data file, and we will pretend that
  the data is arranged in a way that there are 1139 data points in the first
  coordinate direction that are arranged in <i>ascending</i> order but in an
  interval $[-6.983333^\circ,11.98333^\circ]$ (not the negated bounds). Then,
  when we need to look something up for a latitude $\hat\theta$, we can ask the
  interpolating table class for a value at $-\hat\theta$. With this little
  trick, we can avoid having to switch around the order of data as read from
  file.

All of this then calls for a class that essentially looks like this:
@code
  class AfricaTopography
  {
  public:
    AfricaTopography ()
      :
      topography_data (...initialize somehow...)
    {}

    double value (const double lon, const double lat) const
    {
      return topography_data.value (Point<2>(-lat * 180/numbers::PI,
                                             lon * 180/numbers::PI));
    }

  private:
    const Functions::InterpolatedUniformGridData<2> topography_data;
  };
@endcode

Note how the <code>value()</code> function negates the latitude. It also switches
from the format $\phi,\theta$ that we use everywhere else to the latitude-longitude
format used in the table. Finally, it takes its arguments in radians as that is what
we do everywhere else in the program, but then converts them to the degree-based
system used for table lookup. As you will see in the implementation below, the function
has a few more (static) member functions that we will call in the initialization
of the <code>topography_data</code> member variable: the class type of this variable
has a constructor that allows us to set everything right at construction time,
rather than having to fill data later on, but this constructor takes a number of
objects that can't be constructed in-place (at least not in C++98). Consequently,
the construction of each of the objects we want to pass in the initialization happens
in a number of static member functions.

Having discussed the general outline of how we want to implement things, let us go
to the program and show how it is done in practice.


examples/step-53/doc/results.dox
<h1>Results</h1>

Running the program produces a mesh file <code>mesh.vtu</code> that we can
visualize with any of the usual visualization programs that can read the VTU
file format. If one just looks at the mesh itself, it is actually very difficult
to see anything that doesn't just look like a perfectly round piece of a
sphere (though if one modified the program so that it does produce a sphere and
looked at them at the same time, the difference between the overall sphere and
WGS 84 shape is quite apparent). Apparently, Earth is actually quite a flat place.
Of course we already know this from satellite pictures.
However, we can tease out something more by
coloring cells by their volume. This both produces slight variations in hue
along the top surface and something for the visualization programs to apply
their shading algorithms to (because the top surfaces of the cells are now no
longer just tangential to a sphere but tilted):

<img src="https://www.dealii.org/images/steps/developer/step-53.mesh.png" alt="">

Yet, at least as far as visualizations are concerned, this is still not too
impressive. Rather, let us visualize things in a way so that we show the
actual elevation along the top surface. In other words, we want a picture like
this, with an incredible amount of detail:

<img src="https://www.dealii.org/images/steps/developer/step-53.topo.png" alt="">

A zoom-in of this picture shows the vertical displacement quite clearly (here,
looking from the West-Northwest over the rift valley, the triple peaks
of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Stanley">Mount Stanley</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Speke">Mount Speke</a>, and

and toward the great flatness of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Victoria">Lake Victoria</a>):

<img src="https://www.dealii.org/images/steps/developer/step-53.topozoom.png" alt="">


These image were produced with three small modifications:
<ol>
  <li> An additional seventh mesh refinement towards the top surface for the
  first of these two pictures, and a total of nine for the second. In the
  second image, the horizontal mesh size is approximately 1.5km, and just
  under 1km in vertical direction. (The picture was also created using a
  more resolved data set; however, it is too big to distribute as part of
  the tutorial.)

  <li> The addition of the following function that, given a point
  <code>x</code> computes the elevation by converting the point to
  reference WGS 84 coordinates and only keeping the depth variable (the
  function is, consequently, a simplified version of the
  <code>AfricaGeometry::pull_back_wgs84()</code> function):

@code
#include <deal.II/fe/fe_q.h>
#include <deal.II/dofs/dof_handler.h>
#include <deal.II/numerics/data_out.h>
#include <deal.II/numerics/vector_tools.h>


double get_elevation (const Point<3> &x)
  {
    const double R           = 6378137;
    const double ellipticity = 8.1819190842622e-2;

    const double b     = std::sqrt(R * R * (1 - ellipticity * ellipticity));
    const double ep    = std::sqrt((R * R - b * b) / (b * b));
    const double p     = std::sqrt(x(0) * x(0) + x(1) * x(1));
    const double th    = std::atan2(R * x(2), b * p);
    const double theta = std::atan2((x(2) + ep * ep * b * std::sin(th) * std::sin(th) * std::sin(th)),
                                      (p - (ellipticity * ellipticity * R  * (std::cos(th) * std::cos(th) * std::cos(th)))));
    const double R_bar = R / (std::sqrt(1 - ellipticity * ellipticity * std::sin(theta) * std::sin(theta)));
    const double R_plus_d = p / std::cos(theta);

    return R_plus_d - R_bar;
  }
@endcode

  <li>Adding the following piece to the bottom of the <code>run()</code> function:

@code
      FE_Q<3>       fe(1);
      DoFHandler<3> dof_handler (triangulation);
      dof_handler.distribute_dofs(fe);

      Vector<double> elevation (dof_handler.n_dofs());
      {
        std::map<unsigned int,double> boundary_values;
        VectorTools::interpolate_boundary_values(dof_handler,
                                                 5,
                                                 ScalarFunctionFromFunctionObject<3>(get_elevation),
                                                 boundary_values);
        for (std::map<unsigned int,double>::const_iterator p = boundary_values.begin();
             p!=boundary_values.end(); ++p)
          elevation[p->first] = p->second;
      }

      DataOut<3>    data_out;
      data_out.attach_dof_handler(dof_handler);
      data_out.add_data_vector (elevation, "elevation");
      data_out.build_patches();

      std::ofstream out ("data.vtu");
      data_out.write_vtu (out);
@endcode
</ol>
This last piece of code first creates a $Q_1$ finite element space on the mesh.
It then (ab)uses VectorTools::interpolate_boundary_values() to evaluate the
elevation function for every node at the top boundary (the one with boundary
indicator 5). We here wrap the call to <code>get_elevation()</code> with the
ScalarFunctionFromFunctionObject class to make a regular C++ function look
like an object of a class derived from the Function class that we want
to use in VectorTools::interpolate_boundary_values(). Having so gotten a list
of degrees of freedom located at the top boundary and corresponding elevation
values, we just go down this list and set these elevations in the
<code>elevation</code> vector (leaving all interior degrees of freedom at
their original zero value). This vector is then output using DataOut as
usual and can be visualized as shown above.


<h3>Issues with adaptively refined meshes generated this way</h3>

If you zoomed in on the mesh shown above and looked closely enough, you would
find that at hanging nodes, the two small edges connecting to the hanging
nodes are not in exactly the same location as the large edge of the
neighboring cell. This can be shown more clearly by using a different surface
description in which we enlarge the vertical topography to enhance the effect
(courtesy of Alexander Grayver):

<img src="https://www.dealii.org/images/steps/developer/step-53.smooth-geometry.png" alt="">

So what is happening here? Partly, this is only a result of visualization, but
there is an underlying real cause as well:

<ul>
  <li>When you visualize a mesh using any of the common visualization
  programs, what they really show you is just a set of edges that are plotted
  as straight lines in three-dimensional space. This is so because almost all
  data file formats for visualizing data only describe hexahedral cells as a
  collection of eight vertices in 3d space, and do not allow to any more
  complicated descriptions. (This is the main reason why
  DataOut::build_patches() takes an argument that can be set to something
  larger than one.) These linear edges may be the edges of the cell you do
  actual computations on, or they may not, depending on what kind of mapping
  you use when you do your integrations using FEValues. By default, of course,
  FEValues uses a linear mapping (i.e., an object of class MappingQ1) and in
  that case a 3d cell is indeed described exclusively by its 8 vertices and
  the volume it fills is a trilinear interpolation between these points,
  resulting in linear edges. But, you could also have used tri-quadratic,
  tri-cubic, or even higher order mappings and in these cases the volume of
  each cell will be bounded by quadratic, cubic or higher order polynomial
  curves. Yet, you only get to see these with linear edges in the
  visualization program because, as mentioned, file formats do not allow to
  describe the real geometry of cells.

  <li>That said, let us for simplicity assume that you are indeed using a
  trilinear mapping, then the image shown above is a faithful representation
  of the cells on which you form your integrals. In this case, indeed the
  small cells at a hanging nodes do not, in general, snugly fit against the
  large cell but leave a gap or may intersect the larger cell. Why is this?
  Because when the triangulation needs a new vertex on an edge it wants to
  refine, it asks the manifold description where this new vertex is supposed
  to be, and the manifold description duly returns such a point by (in the
  case of a geometry derived from ChartManifold) pulling the adjacent points
  of the line back to the reference domain, averaging their locations, and
  pushing forward this new location to the real domain. But this new location
  is not usually along a straight line (in real space) between the adjacent
  vertices and consequently the two small straight lines forming the refined
  edge do not lie exactly on the one large straight line forming the unrefined
  side of the hanging node.
</ul>

The situation is slightly more complicated if you use a higher order mapping
using the MappingQ class, but not fundamentally different. Let's take a
quadratic mapping for the moment (nothing fundamental changes with even higher
order mappings). Then you need to imagine each edge of the cells you integrate
on as a quadratic curve despite the fact that you will never actually see it
plotted that way by a visualization program. But imagine it that way for a
second. So which quadratic curve does MappingQ take? It is the quadratic curve
that goes through the two vertices at the end of the edge as well as a point
in the middle that it queries from the manifold. In the case of the long edge
on the unrefined side, that's of course exactly the location of the hanging
node, so the quadratic curve describing the long edge does go through the
hanging node, unlike in the case of the linear mapping. But the two small
edges are also quadratic curves; for example, the left small edge will go
through the left vertex of the long edge and the hanging node, plus a point it
queries halfway in between from the manifold. Because, as before, the point
the manifold returns halfway along the left small edge is rarely exactly on
the quadratic curve describing the long edge, the quadratic short edge will
typically not coincide with the left half of the quadratic long edge, and the
same is true for the right short edge. In other words, again, the geometries
of the large cell and its smaller neighbors at hanging nodes do not touch
snuggly.

This all begs two questions: first, does it matter, and second, could this be
fixed. Let us discuss these in the following:

<ul>
  <li>Does it matter? It is almost certainly true that this depends on the
  equation you are solving. For example, it is known that solving the Euler
  equations of gas dynamics on complex geometries requires highly accurate
  boundary descriptions to ensure convergence of quantities that are measure
  the flow close to the boundary. On the other hand, equations with elliptic
  components (e.g., the Laplace or Stokes equations) are typically rather
  forgiving of these issues: one does quadrature anyway to approximate
  integrals, and further approximating the geometry may not do as much harm as
  one could fear given that the volume of the overlaps or gaps at every
  hanging node is only ${\cal O}(h^d)$ even with a linear mapping and ${\cal
  O}(h^{d+p-1})$ for a mapping of degree $p$. (You can see this by considering
  that in 2d the gap/overlap is a triangle with base $h$ and height ${\cal
  O}(h)$; in 3d, it is a pyramid-like structure with base area $h^2$ and
  height ${\cal O}(h)$. Similar considerations apply for higher order mappings
  where the height of the gaps/overlaps is ${\cal O}(h^p)$.) In other words,
  if you use a linear mapping with linear elements, the error in the volume
  you integrate over is already at the same level as the integration error
  using the usual Gauss quadrature. Of course, for higher order elements one
  would have to choose matching mapping objects.

  Another point of view on why it is probably not worth worrying too much
  about the issue is that there is certainly no narrative in the community of
  numerical analysts that these issues are a major concern one needs to watch
  out for when using complex geometries. If it does not seem to be discussed
  often among practitioners, if ever at all, then it is at least not something
  people have identified as a common problem.

  This issue is not dissimilar to having hanging nodes at curved boundaries
  where the geometry description of the boundary typically pulls a hanging
  node onto the boundary whereas the large edge remains straight, making the
  adjacent small and large cells not match each other. Although this behavior
  existed in deal.II since its beginning, 15 years before manifold
  descriptions became available, it did not ever come up in mailing list
  discussions or conversations with colleagues.

  <li>Could it be fixed? In principle, yes, but it's a complicated
  issue. Let's assume for the moment that we would only ever use the MappingQ1
  class, i.e., linear mappings. In that case, whenever the triangulation class
  requires a new vertex along an edge that would become a hanging node, it
  would just take the mean value of the adjacent vertices <i>in real
  space</i>, i.e., without asking the manifold description. This way, the
  point lies on the long straight edge and the two short straight edges would
  match the one long edge. Only when all adjacent cells have been refined and
  the point is no longer a hanging node would we replace its coordinates by
  coordinates we get by a manifold. This may be awkward to implement, but it
  would certainly be possible.

  The more complicated issue arises because people may want to use a higher
  order MappingQ object. In that case, the Triangulation class may freely
  choose the location of the hanging node (because the quadratic curve for the
  long edge can be chosen in such a way that it goes through the hanging node)
  but the MappingQ class, when determining the location of mid-edge points
  must make sure that if the edge is one half of a long edge of a neighboring
  coarser cell, then the midpoint cannot be obtained from the manifold but
  must be chosen along the long quadratic edge. For cubic (and all other odd)
  mappings, the matter is again a bit complicated because one typically
  arranges the cubic edge to go through points 1/3 and 2/3 along the edge, and
  thus necessarily through the hanging node, but this could probably be worked
  out. In any case, even then, there are two problems with this:

  - When refining the triangulation, the Triangulation class can not know what
    mapping will be used. In fact it is not uncommon for a triangulation to be
    used differently in different contexts within the same program. If the
    mapping used determines whether we can freely choose a point or not, how,
    then, should the triangulation locate new vertices?
  - Mappings are purely local constructs: they only work on a cell in
    isolation, and this is one of the important features of the finite element
    method. Having to ask whether one of the vertices of an edge is a hanging
    node requires querying the neighborhood of a cell; furthermore, such a
    query does not just involve the 6 face neighbors of a cell in 3d, but may
    require traversing a possibly very large number of other cells that
    connect to an edge. Even if it can be done, one still needs to do
    different things depending on how the neighborhood looks like, producing
    code that is likely very complex, hard to maintain, and possibly slow.

  Consequently, at least for the moment, none of these ideas are
  implemented. This leads to the undesirable consequence of discontinuous
  geometries, but, as discussed above, the effects of this do not appear to
  pose problem in actual practice.
