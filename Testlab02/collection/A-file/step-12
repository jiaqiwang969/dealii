<h1>An example of an advection problem using the Discountinuous Galerkin method</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

This example is devoted to the <em>discontinuous
Galerkin method</em>, or in short, the DG method. It includes the following topics.
<ol>
  <li> Discretization of the linear advection equation with the DG method.
  <li> Assembling of jump terms and other expressions on the interface between cells using FEInterfaceValues.
  <li> Assembling of the system matrix using the MeshWorker::mesh_loop().
</ol>

The particular concern of this program are the loops of DG methods. These turn
out to be especially complex, primarily because for the face terms, we have to
distinguish the cases of boundary, regular interior faces and interior faces
with hanging nodes, respectively. The MeshWorker::mesh_loop() handles the
complexity on iterating over cells and faces and allows specifying "workers"
for the different cell and face terms. The integration of face terms itself,
including on adaptively refined faces, is done using the FEInterfaceValues
class.

<h3>The equation</h3>

The model problem solved in this example is the linear advection equation
@f[
  \nabla\cdot \left({\mathbf \beta} u\right)=0 \qquad\mbox{in }\Omega,
@f]
subject to the boundary conditions
@f[
u=g\quad\mbox{on }\Gamma_-,
@f]
on the inflow part $\Gamma_-$ of the boundary $\Gamma=\partial\Omega$
of the domain.  Here, ${\mathbf \beta}={\mathbf \beta}({\bf x})$ denotes a
vector field, $u$ the (scalar) solution
function, $g$ a boundary value function,
@f[
\Gamma_- \dealcoloneq \{{\bf x}\in\Gamma, {\mathbf \beta}({\bf x})\cdot{\bf n}({\bf x})<0\}
@f]
the inflow part of the boundary of the domain and ${\bf n}$ denotes
the unit outward normal to the boundary $\Gamma$. This equation is the
conservative version of the advection equation already considered in
step-9 of this tutorial.


On each cell $T$, we multiply by a test function $v_h$ from the left and integrate by parts
to get:
@f[
  \left( v_h, \nabla \cdot (\beta u_h) \right)_T
= -(\nabla v_h, \beta u_h) + \int_\Gamma v_h u_h \beta \cdot n
@f]
When summing this expression over all cells $T$, the boundary integral is done over
all internal and external faces and as such there are three cases:
<ol>
<li> outer boundary on the inflow (we replace $u_h$ by given $g$):
  $\int_{\Gamma_-} v_h g \beta \cdot n$
<li> outer boundary on the outflow:
  $\int_{\Gamma_+} v_h u_h \beta \cdot n$
<li> inner faces (integral from two sides turns into jump, we use the upwind velocity):
  $\int_F [v_h] u_h^{\text{upwind}} \beta \cdot n$
</ol>

Here, the jump is defined as $[v] = v^+ - v^-$, where the superscripts refer
to the left ('+') and right ('-') values at the face. The upwind value
$u^{\text{upwind}}$ is defined to be $u^+$ if $\beta \cdot n>0$ and $u^-$ otherwise.

As a result, the mesh-dependent weak form reads:
@f[
\sum_{T\in \mathbb T_h} -\bigl(\nabla \phi_i,{\mathbf \beta}\cdot \phi_j \bigr)_T +
\sum_{F\in\mathbb F_h^i} \bigl< [\phi_i], \phi_j^{upwind} \beta\cdot \mathbf n\bigr>_{F} +
\bigl<\phi_i, \phi_j \beta\cdot \mathbf n\bigr>_{\Gamma_+}
= -\bigl<\phi_i, g \beta\cdot\mathbf n\bigr>_{\Gamma_-}.
@f]
Here, $\mathbb T_h$ is the set of all active cells of the triangulation
and $\mathbb F_h^i$ is the set of all active interior faces. This formulation
is known as the upwind discontinuous Galerkin method.

In order to implement this bilinear form, we need to compute the cell terms
(first sum) using the usual way to achieve integration on a cell, the interface terms (second sum) using
FEInterfaceValues, and the boundary terms (the other two terms).
The summation of all those is done by MeshWorker::mesh_loop().



<h3>The test problem</h3>

We solve the advection equation on
$\Omega=[0,1]^2$ with ${\mathbf \beta}=\frac{1}{|x|}(-x_2, x_1)$
representing a circular counterclockwise flow field, and $g=1$
on ${\bf x}\in\Gamma_-^1 := [0,0.5]\times\{0\}$ and $g=0$ on ${\bf x}\in
\Gamma_-\setminus \Gamma_-^1$.

We solve on a sequence of meshes by refining the mesh adaptively by estimating
the norm of the gradient on each cell. After solving on each mesh, we output
the solution in vtk format and compute the $L^\infty$ norm of the solution. As
the exact solution is either 0 or 1, we can measure the magnitude of the
overshoot of the numerical solution with this.

<h3>Why use discontinuous elements</h3>

In this program we have used discontinuous elements. It is a legitimate
question to ask why not simply use the normal, continuous ones. Of course, to
everyone with a background in numerical methods, the answer is obvious: the
continuous Galerkin (cG) method is not stable for the transport equation,
unless one specifically adds stabilization terms. The DG method, however,
<i>is</i> stable. Illustrating this with the current program is not very
difficult; in fact, only the following minor modifications are necessary:
- Change the element to FE_Q instead of FE_DGQ.
- Add handling of hanging node constraints in exactly the same way as step-6.
- We need a different solver; the direct solver in step-29 is a convenient
  choice.
An experienced deal.II user will be able to do this in less than 10 minutes.

While the 2d solution has been shown above, containing a number of small
spikes at the interface that are, however, stable in height under mesh
refinement, results look much different when using a continuous element:

In refinement iteration 5, the image can't be plotted in a reasonable way any
more as a 3d plot. We thus show a color plot with a range of $[-1,2]$ (the
solution values of the exact solution lie in $[0,1]$, of course). In any case,
it is clear that the continuous Galerkin solution exhibits oscillatory
behavior that gets worse and worse as the mesh is refined more and more.

There are a number of strategies to stabilize the cG method, if one wants to
use continuous elements for some reason. Discussing these methods is beyond
the scope of this tutorial program; an interested reader could, for example,
take a look at step-31.

<h3>Possibilities for extensions</h3>

Given that the exact solution is known in this case, one interesting
avenue for further extensions would be to confirm the order of
convergence for this program. In the current case, the solution is
non-smooth, and so we can not expect to get a particularly high order
of convergence, even if we used higher order elements. But even if the
solution <i>is</i> smooth, the equation is not elliptic and so it is not
immediately clear that we should obtain a convergence order that
equals that of the optimal interpolation estimates (i.e. for example
that we would get $h^3$ convergence in the $L^2$ norm by using
quadratic elements).

In fact, for hyperbolic equations, theoretical predictions often
indicate that the best one can hope for is an order one half below the
interpolation estimate. For example, for the streamline diffusion
method (an alternative method to the DG method used here to stabilize
the solution of the transport equation), one can prove that for
elements of degree $p$, the order of convergence is $p+\frac 12$ on
arbitrary meshes. While the observed order is frequently $p+1$ on
uniformly refined meshes, one can construct so-called Peterson meshes
on which the worse theoretical bound is actually attained. This should
be relatively simple to verify, for example using the
VectorTools::integrate_difference function.

A different direction is to observe that the solution of transport problems
often has discontinuities and that therefore a mesh in which we <i>bisect</i>
every cell in every coordinate direction may not be optimal. Rather, a better
strategy would be to only cut cells in the direction parallel to the
discontinuity. This is called <i>anisotropic mesh refinement</i> and is the
subject of step-30.
